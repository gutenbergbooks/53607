<p>“Sufferin’ whirligigs, Pard Matt! Look at that bubble
wagon! Is it trying to turn a handspring, or ‘skin
the cat,’ or climb that telephone pole? I reckon the
longhorn up front don’t know how to run the thing.
Either that, or else he’s ‘bug’ with a big ‘B.’”</p>

<p>“I should say it’s the car that’s ‘bug,’ Joe. The driver
seems to be trying to control the machine in the proper
manner, but it won’t be controlled. What’s your notion
of it, Billy?”</p>

<p>“Hoodoo car, Matt. Look at the number of her&mdash;thirteen
thirteen. Double hoodoo. You couldn’t expect
no chug wagon with such a tag to behave anything else
than disgraceful. Lo and behold you, if she don’t turn
turtle in the ditch before she goes many more miles
then my name’s not Billy Wells. Watch ’er; keep your
eye on ’er an’ I’ll bet you see something.”</p>

<p>The three boys were driving along the Jericho Pike
well toward Krug’s Corner&mdash;Matt King, Joe McGlory,
and Billy Wells. Billy belonged with a New York
garage from which the boys had secured the touring
car they were using that morning. He was a living
road map, this Billy, and could go anywhere up-state,
or over Long Island, or in Jersey on the darkest
night that ever fell, and he knew every minute just
where he was.</p>

<p>Matt was doing the driving, and Billy sat beside him
as guide, counselor, and friend. In the back of the
machine was McGlory.</p>

<p>That was Thursday. Matt and his chum were heeding
a summons that carried them toward the Malvern
Country Club, near Hempstead. After transacting their
business at the Country Club&mdash;they did not know what
it was, but believed it would not take them long&mdash;they
were planning to return to Krug’s Corner for their
noon meal, and then back to Manhattan by Jackson
Avenue and the Williamsburg Bridge. But plans are
easily made, sometimes, and not so easily carried out.</p>

<p>The day was bright, the roads were good, and the
motor boys were enjoying themselves. Well along the
Jericho Pike they had come up with a white runabout,
two seats in front and a deck behind, and the actions
of this car aroused their curiosity to such an extent
that Matt slowed down the big machine in order that
he and those with him could follow and watch the performance.</p>

<p>There was only one passenger in the white car, and he
was having his hands full.</p>

<p>The runabout would angle from one side of the road
to the other, in apparent defiance of the way the steering
wheel was held, and sometimes it would go its eccentric
course slowly and sometimes with a rush&mdash;so
far as those in the other car could see&mdash;without any
change in the speed gear.</p>

<p>The driver of the runabout worked frantically to keep
the machine where it ought to be, but the task was too
much for him.</p>

<p>Once a telephone pole gave him a close shave, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
once his unmanageable car gave a sidewise lurch that
almost hurled it into a machine going the other way.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” Matt hailed.</p>

<p>The man in the runabout looked around with a facial
expression that was far from angelic.</p>

<p>“If I knew what was the matter with this confounded
car,” he cried in exasperation, “do you think I’d be side-stepping
all over the road the way I am?” Then, muttering
to himself, he humped over the steering wheel
again.</p>

<p>“He’s happy&mdash;I don’t think,” chuckled McGlory.
“The car’s getting on his nerves.”</p>

<p>“A car like that would get on anybody’s nerves,”
commented Billy. “The number’s enough to set mine
on edge. Thirteen’s unlucky, no matter where you find
it. That’s right. And when you get two thirteens
bunched together, you’ve sure got a combination that
points a car for the scrap heap. I wouldn’t hold down
the cushions in that roadster for all the money in New
York. No, sir, that I wouldn’t,” and Billy shook his
head forebodingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, splash!” scoffed Matt. “When a car fools
around like that, Billy, there’s something wrong with
its internal apparatus.”</p>

<p>“Matt,” went on Billy solemnly, “I’ve seen cars that
hadn’t a thing wrong with ’em, but they was just naturally
crazy and never’d run right. Steer ’em straight,
an’ they’d go crooked; point ’em crooked, an’ they’d go
straight; throw on the reverse, an’ they’d go for’ard;
give ’em the third speed an’ they’d crawl; give ’em the
first an’ they’d tear away like lightnin’&mdash;and all the
while, mind you, the engine was running as sweet as any
engine you ever see. The Old Boy himself takes charge
of some cars the moment they’re sold and in a customer’s
hands. I’ve worked in a garage for five years,
and I know.”</p>

<p>Matt laughed. McGlory laughed, too, but not so
mirthfully. The cowboy had a little superstition in his
make-up and Billy’s remarks had left a fleeting impression.</p>

<p>“Gammon, Billy, gammon,” said Matt. “If a car is
built right, and works right, it is going to run right.
That stands to reason.”</p>

<p>“A lot of things happen,” insisted Billy, “that don’t
stand to reason. Now, take that runabout. The engine’s
working fine&mdash;from the sound of it. Eh?”</p>

<p>Matt admitted that, so far as the hum of the motor
was concerned, the machinery seemed to be doing its
part.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” cried the triumphant Billy, “why don’t
the blooming car run like it ought to?”</p>

<p>“It’s the steering gear that’s wrong,” Matt answered,
“not the engine, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>Just then the runabout blew up a forward tire. The
machine tried to turn a somersault, and its passenger
went over on the hood and tried to knock off one of
the gas lamps with his head. When Matt brought the
touring car to the side of the runabout, and halted,
the man was on his feet, shaking his fist at the silent
white tormentor.</p>

<p>“If I had a stick of dynamite,” he declared wrathfully,
“I’d blow this infernal machine to kingdom come!
I’ve been fiddling around the Jericho Road for two mortal
hours, and I could have made better time if I’d
left the car and gone on afoot. But I’ll hang to it, and
make it take me where I’m going. By George, I’ll not
be beaten by a senseless contraption of tires, mud
guards, and machinery.”</p>

<p>Matt had jumped out of the touring car and was
sniffing at the damaged tire.</p>

<p>“What makes that smell of gasoline?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I put in a tube this morning, and washed out the
chalk with gasoline,” said the man.</p>

<p>“Never use gasoline for cleaning the tubes,” counseled
Matt. “Get all the chalk you can from the outer
tube, and then soak it in wood naphtha or ordinary alcohol.
No wonder your tire blew up. You left gasoline
in the shoe, and when it got hot, it mixed with a
little air in the tube and something had to happen. Have
you got another shoe?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And a jack?”</p>

<p>“Of course. When a man goes out with a car like
this he ought to carry a small garage around with
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll help you get on the shoe.”</p>

<p>Matt and Billy worked. McGlory stood near, watching
and talking with the owner of the car.</p>

<p>After the tire had been repaired, Matt looked over
the runabout critically. Much to his amazement, he
could find nothing wrong.</p>

<p>“It’s the double hoodoo,” whispered Billy; “that’s all
that’s the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged to you,” said the man, cranking up.
“Now we’ll see how she acts.”</p>

<p>He got in, went through the operations for a fresh
start, but the runabout began backing. While the man
shouted, and said things, the runabout backed in a circle
around the big touring car, then dropped rearward
down a shallow embankment at the roadside&mdash;and its
passenger had another spill, out over the rear deck this
time. For a second, he stood on his head and shoulders,
then turned clear over and made a quick move sideways
in getting to his feet. He was afraid, evidently, that
the runabout was coming on top of him. But the car,
almost in defiance of the laws of gravitation, hung
to the side of the steep bank, its position nearly perpendicular.</p>

<p>“Speak to me about that!” gasped McGlory.</p>

<p>Matt was scared. From the top of the bank he stood
staring while the man got out of the way.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” Matt asked.</p>

<p>“No thanks to that fiendish machine if I am,” sputtered
the man, laboring frantically up the slope. “It
has tried to kill me in a dozen different ways since I
left home with it. I’m done. Life’s too short to bother
with such an infernal car as that.”</p>

<p>Fairly boiling with rage, he started along the road on
foot.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!” shouted Matt. “Where you going?”</p>

<p>The man turned.</p>

<p>“Krug’s,” he answered. “I’ll get a decent, respectable
car there to take me on.”</p>

<p>“You can telephone to a garage from Krug’s,” suggested
Billy, “and they can send some one to get the
runabout home.”</p>

<p>“I’m done with the runabout, I tell you. It can stay
where it is until the tires rot, for all of me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll agree to get it back to the city for you,” said
Matt. “My name’s King, Matt King, and I’m staying
at&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>The man’s rage subsided a little.</p>

<p>“You’re Matt King?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I understand, now, how you happen to know so
much about tubes. They say you’re pretty well up in
motors, too. Well, here’s where I give you the job of
your life. Matt King, I make you a present of that
runabout. Take it&mdash;but Heaven help you if you try
to run it.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the man whirled around and strode off.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say,” yelled Matt, “you don’t mean it. Wait,
and I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the man swung onward, paying no heed to what
Matt was calling after him.</p>

<p>Matt King turned and peered in amazement at his
cowboy chum.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ tenterhooks!” exclaimed McGlory. “You’re
loaded up with a bunch of trouble now, pard.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” urged Billy, moving toward the touring
car with considerable haste. “Don’t lay a finger on
that runabout&mdash;don’t have a thing to do with it.”</p>

<p>But Matt was face to face with a proposition that
caught his fancy. A refractory automobile! Never yet
had he encountered a machine that had got the best
of him. And this runabout couldn’t do it&mdash;he was positive
of that.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">MATT KING’S RESOLVE.</span></a></h2>


<p>“That man was so mad he was locoed,” observed the
cowboy.</p>

<p>“Certainly he was, Joe,” agreed Matt. “If he hadn’t
been, he’d never have given away that machine. It’s
a powerful car and worth twenty-five hundred of any
man’s money.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tamper with it, Matt,” implored Billy. “When
that fellow gets over his mad spell he’ll want the runabout
back. Let him have it&mdash;and let him find it right
where he left it.”</p>

<p>“If he hadn’t been worked up like he was,” said Matt,
“he wouldn’t have given the car to me. I won’t take
it, of course, but Joe and I will use it to take us to the
Malvern Country Club, and then back to Manhattan.
By to-morrow that fellow will be looking for me and
wanting his car back.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think of such a thing as wanting to
bother with that runabout!” gasped Billy, from his seat
in the touring car.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” answered Matt. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“The number&mdash;thirteen thirteen!”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“It’s a hoodoo car.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that, Billy. You go on to Krug’s
Corner and get a stout rope. If you overtake the owner
of the runabout you can give him a lift. See him, anyhow,
and tell him we’ll take the runabout to New
York and that he can have it whenever he wants it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it!” begged Billy. “I’ve seen enough of
these hoodoo cars to know they’ll prove the death of
somebody. Don’t let that runabout prove the death of
you!”</p>

<p>“Go get the rope, Billy,” said Matt sharply, “and
hustle back with it.”</p>

<p>There was that in the voice of Matt King which proved
that he had made up his mind, and that there was no
shaking his determination. With an ominous movement
of the head, Billy started for Krug’s Corner.</p>

<p>“Pard,” remarked McGlory earnestly, “I reckon the
runabout is heap bad medicine. Do you think you ought
to mix up with it?”</p>

<p>“Are you going back on me, Joe?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“Not so you can notice. I’d get on a streak of
greased lightning with you, if you said the word, and
help you ride it to the end of the One-way Trail, but
I think this is too big an order for us. Sufferin’ thunderbolts!
Why, pard, that car won’t mind the helm or
do the thing it ought to do even when you pull the
right thing. When it began to crawfish around the road,
the reverse wasn’t on.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. It’s on now,” and he looked
down at the runabout. “I guess the man must have
thrown on the reverse instinctively when the tire blew
up. Think of rinsing the chalk from the outer tube
with gasoline!” Matt laughed. “There was good cause
for the tire going wrong, and there may be other good
and sufficient causes for the machine’s sizzling around
like it did. Anyhow, we’ll try it, and see how it will
behave for us.”</p>

<p>“But how can we lay a course for the Malvern Country
Club? Billy will have to show us.”</p>

<p>“Billy can tell us how to go, and we’ll get to the
Country Club all right. Hello! What’s this?”</p>

<p>Matt began slipping and sliding down the slope at
the side of the runabout. Just at the point where the
driver of the car had taken his header, the young motorist
picked up a long manila envelope, unsealed.</p>

<p>“I reckon that dropped out of the man’s clothes while
he was upside down,” ventured McGlory.</p>

<p>“That’s a cinch,” said Matt. “There’s no address on
the envelope, and no printed card in the corner, but it
may be we can find the man’s name and address on the
papers inside. If he won’t come for his car, we’ll take
it to him.”</p>

<p>“I’m a Piute,” mumbled McGlory, “if I feel right
about this runabout business.”</p>

<p>“Billy’s talk about hoodoo cars has got you on the
run,” grinned Matt. “You’ll feel different when we’re
slamming along the pike with the runabout under perfect
control. It’s my opinion that man doesn’t know
a whole lot about running a car.”</p>

<p>While Matt was moving here and there about the
steep bank, making a few investigations of the “hoodoo”
machine, Billy came racing back.</p>

<p>“There’s your rope, Matt,” said he, tossing a coiled
cable into the road.</p>

<p>Matt crept warily up the bank to the front of the
runabout.</p>

<p>“Did you see the man, Billy?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure I did. Let him ride with me for half a mile.”</p>

<p>“You told him what we were going to do?”</p>

<p>“I did. He says that if you get that car back to the
city, and try to turn it over to him, he’ll have you arrested
for assault with intent to do great bodily damage.
He says the runabout is a powder mine, and liable
to blow up at any minute. ‘Tell Matt King to keep it,’
he said, ‘providing he’s got the nerve.’ That’s the way
he handed it to me. Take my advice,” Billy clamored
desperately, “and leave it alone!”</p>

<p>“Joe and I are going to use it,” answered Matt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“Hand me an end of that rope, pard,” he added to the
cowboy.</p>

<p>McGlory passed him the rope, and Matt made it secure
to the front of the runabout.</p>

<p>“Back up, Billy,” called Matt, “and tie the other end
of the rope to the touring car. You’ve got to give us
a lift into the road.”</p>

<p>“What if something should happen?” demurred Billy.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Matt impatiently.</p>

<p>“You can’t give the car back to that fellow if he
won’t take it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make him take it. He’s a very foolish man,
and he’s going to feel differently when his temper
cools.”</p>

<p>Billy, not in a very comfortable frame of mind, backed
the touring car close to the edge of the bank. The
rope was made fast, and Matt and McGlory went to the
foot of the bank to push while the big machine pulled.</p>

<p>The attempt was successful. The runabout sputtered&mdash;perhaps
defiantly&mdash;as it yielded to the tugging and
rolled up the slope. Matt looked the machine over
and could not find that it had suffered any by the slide
down the slope.</p>

<p>“It’ll hang together till it gets you, Motor Matt,” observed
Billy grewsomely. “That’s the way with these
hoodoo cars. They never go to pieces till they kill somebody.”</p>

<p>“You’re too good a driver, Billy, to talk such foolishness,”
returned Matt. “Now, tell us how to get to the
Malvern Country Club.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I going with you?”</p>

<p>“Three of us couldn’t ride very comfortably in the
runabout.”</p>

<p>“But hadn’t I better go along in the touring car so
as to be handy in case of accidents?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Joe and I will get along. We’re not going to
have any accidents if we can help it&mdash;and I feel pretty
sure we can.”</p>

<p>Billy laid out the course the boys were to take with
considerable detail. When he was through, Matt felt
that he had the route clearly fixed in his mind.</p>

<p>“If the runabout’s too much for you,” Billy finished,
“all you’ve got to do is to phone the garage, and I’ll
come a-runnin’.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get the rope?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>Billy told him he had borrowed it at Krug’s.</p>

<p>“We’ll leave it there,” said Matt, “on our way past
the Corner.”</p>

<p>“You may never get to Krug’s,” answered Billy, in
extreme dejection.</p>

<p>“Pile in, Joe,” said Matt, “and we’ll throw in the
clutch and scoot.”</p>

<p>McGlory, it must be admitted, climbed into the runabout
in a way that proved his lack of confidence. Matt
cranked up, listening with deep satisfaction to the smooth
singing of the engine, and then got into the driver’s
seat.</p>

<p>Billy, in the touring car, watched tremulously and
waited. From his appearance, he was plainly expecting
that the white car would turn a few cartwheels and
perhaps land upside down in the middle of the road
with Matt and McGlory underneath.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort happened. Car No. 1313
moved off in the direction of Krug’s as nice as you
please&mdash;moved on a hair line, with none of the distressing
wabbling which characterized its previous performance
with its owner at the wheel.</p>

<p>The cowboy gathered confidence. Looking behind, he
waved his hat at Billy.</p>

<p>“Don’t whistle till you’re out of the woods!” yelled
Billy.</p>

<p>He shouted something else, but his words faded out in
the increasing distance.</p>

<p>“Speak to me concerning this!” laughed McGlory,
straightening around in his seat. “This little old chug
cart is a false alarm, after all. It seems to understand
that there’s a fellow in charge who knows the ropes
up and down and across. Fine!”</p>

<p>“We’ll see the owner of the machine at Krug’s,” said
Matt, “and get his address.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t have the runabout till we’re done with
it,” protested McGlory.</p>

<p>“I should say not! We’ve sent Billy home, and that
leaves us only this car to take us back. Ah, there’s
Krug’s! We’ll stop for a few minutes.”</p>

<p>Matt tried to stop, but he couldn’t. He went through
all the motions for cutting off the flow of gasoline and
switching off the spark. The clutch was out, but the
engine still had the car, and the engine wouldn’t stop.</p>

<p>An automobile was just coming out of the sheds. The
runabout came within an ace of a head-on collision.
Fortunately the steering gear still worked, and Matt
scraped mud guards with the other car and he and his
cowboy chum bounded on along the road.</p>

<p>McGlory yelled frantically. “Jump!” he cried; “let
the old contraption run its blooming head off!”</p>

<p>But Matt wouldn’t jump, and he wouldn’t let his chum
go over the flying wheels. Dazed and bewildered, he
bore down on the brake.</p>

<p>The speed slackened, but they were half a mile beyond
Krug’s before the car made up its mind to stop.
Then McGlory tumbled out, while Matt sat astounded,
his arms folded over the steering wheel and such a
look on his face as the cowboy had never seen there
before.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">A DEMON IN CONTROL.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Get out of that, pard! Get out!” McGlory was
wild with apprehension, and sprang up and down at
the roadside and waved his arms. “The way that car
acts would make the hair stand up on a buffalo robe!
What are you staying there for?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to guess how that happened,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“Then stop guessing. You can guess till you’re black
in the face and you’ll still be up in the air. Cut loose
from that bubble wagon&mdash;that’s your cue and mine.”</p>

<p>“There’s a reason for the car acting as it does,” declared
Matt, “and I’m going to get down to the bottom
of the mystery. We might just as well put in a little
time right here. It’s not a very long run to the Malvern
Country Club, and we can waste another half hour without
missing your appointment.”</p>

<p>“If you took my advice,” muttered McGlory, “you
wouldn’t touch that machine with a ten-foot pole.”</p>

<p>There was a determined look on Matt’s face as he
leaped into the road and began an exhaustive examination.
He could find nothing wrong; nevertheless, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
went over the ignition system carefully, step by step;
then he took the carburetor to pieces, ran pins through
the spray nozzle and sandpapered the float guides; and,
after that, he went under the car, broke the gasoline
connections and drew wires through the tubes.</p>

<p>The cowboy heaved a long breath of relief as Matt
reappeared from under the car.</p>

<p>“Find anything out of whack, pard?” McGlory asked.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” answered the mystified Matt.</p>

<p>“Then you’re about ready to admit there’s a demon
in control of the car?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in demons.”</p>

<p>“If a car won’t stop when it ought to stop, and if it
won’t go straight when you’re steering that way, and if
it backs up when everything is set for going ahead, I’m
a Piute if I don’t think there’s something else got a hand
in running it.”</p>

<p>Matt was silent. He was facing a proposition that
was new to him, but he was dealing with motor details
with which he was perfectly familiar. Here was an ordinary
four-cycle engine, and an ordinary float-feed
carburetor; the transmission was of the common sliding-gear
variety; the fuel tank was under the seat, and
the gasoline was fed into the engine by gravity. Why
was it that the different parts did not coöperate as
they should?</p>

<p>“Come on, Joe,” said Matt, putting on the coat which
he had laid off while at work, “we’ll go back to Krug’s
and see if my tinkering has helped any.”</p>

<p>“I can’t pass up the invitation, pard,” returned McGlory,
“but if any one else gave it to me, I’d say <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">manana</i>.
Every minute we’re aboard that runabout, we’re
sitting on a thunderbolt that’s not more than half tame.
Here goes, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The cowboy climbed to his place, and Matt “turned
the engine over” and got in beside him. Then they
backed until the runabout was headed the other way,
whereupon Matt changed speeds and they slid over the
pike as easily as a girl tripping to market. No. 1313
behaved like the prince of cars. No one, from its present
performance, could ever have dreamed that it was
anything but the mildest-mannered little buzz wagon
that had ever come out of the shop.</p>

<p>“I’m stumped,” declared McGlory. “She acts as
though she had never thought of such a thing as taking
the bit in her teeth. I reckon, pard, you must have
done something that started her to working in the right
way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never be able to understand how she ran for half
a mile without any gas in the cylinders or any spark
to cause an explosion,” said Matt, as he came to a stop
in front of Krug’s. “Return the rope, Joe,” he added,
“and see if you can find the owner of the runabout.”</p>

<p>McGlory was gone for ten minutes. When he came
back he reported that the man who had cut loose from
the runabout was nowhere to be found, and that a fellow
answering his description had been taken into a
car by a friend and had motored off in the direction of
Hempstead.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Matt, “we’ll stop thinking about the
owner of the car and continue to use it just as though
it belonged to us.”</p>

<p>They turned south from the Corner and moved away
in the direction of Hempstead at a good rate of speed.
The runabout kept up its excellent behavior, answering
instantly Matt’s slightest touch on steering wheel or levers.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the best of her, pard,” observed McGlory.
“When you hip-locked with her, after she ran away
from Krug’s, you must have poked a wire into something
that was causing all the trouble.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have done that,” answered Matt. “Still,
no matter what the reason, the car is acting handsomely
now, and we’ll let it go at that. Read that telegram to
me again, Joe.”</p>

<p>McGlory fished around in his pocket until he had
brought up a folded yellow sheet. Opening it out, he
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘Meeting of syndicate in the matter of ”Pauper’s
Dream“ Mine postponed from Wednesday night to
Thursday night. Meet me eleven o’clock Thursday Malvern
Country Club, near Hempstead, Long Island. Important.</p>

<p class="marginrightindent">“‘<span class="smcap">Joshua Griggs.</span>’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “Pauper’s Dream” Mine was located near Tucson,
in Arizona. It was owned by a stock company,
and the cowboy had a hundred shares of the stock. A
friend of his, named Colonel Mark Antony Billings, had
induced him to invest in the “Pauper’s Dream” when
it was little more than an undeveloped claim. Development
seemingly proved the claim worthless, and McGlory
had been surprised, while he and Matt were in
New York, to receive a letter stating that a rich vein
had been struck, and that the colonel was planning to
sell the property at a big figure to a syndicate of New
York capitalists. Random &amp; Griggs, brokers, in Liberty
Street, were the colonel’s New York agents, and the
meeting of the syndicate was to be held in their office.</p>

<p>Two bars of gold bullion from the “Pauper’s Dream”
mill had been sent by the colonel to New York, and
McGlory had been requested to get the bullion and exhibit
it to the members of the syndicate at the meeting.
Matt and McGlory had had a good deal of trouble with
that bullion, and the cowboy was not intending to take
it from the bank, to whose care it had been consigned,
until three o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, this telegram from Griggs was taking the
boys to the Malvern Country Club; but just why it was
necessary for McGlory to talk with Griggs was more
than either of the lads could understand.</p>

<p>“Griggs, I reckon,” said McGlory, as he returned the
telegram to his pocket, “is one of the members of the
firm of Random &amp; Griggs.”</p>

<p>“That’s my guess,” returned Matt; “but, if he is, why
couldn’t he talk with you at the office in Liberty Street
instead of having you come all the way out here?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to shy at that, pard. Maybe Griggs is a
plutocrat, and is accustomed to having people jump
whenever he cracks the whip. Like as not he didn’t
want to go in to the office to-day and just shot that
message at us to save him the trouble of going too far
for a palaver.”</p>

<p>“He told you all it was necessary for you to know,
in the message. The meeting was postponed from last
night to to-night. What else is there that he could
want to tell you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pass again. Maybe he wants to ask about the
colonel’s health, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The cowboy bit off his words suddenly. Without the
least warning, the runabout had made a wild lunge toward
the side of the road.</p>

<p>“She’s cut loose again!” yelled McGlory, hanging to
the seat with both hands.</p>

<p>Matt was holding the steering wheel firmly. So far
as he could see, there was not the least excuse for
the car’s making that frantic plunge toward the roadside.</p>

<p>Just ahead of the machine was a railroad track, and
the noise of an approaching train was loud in the boys’
ears. Matt was thinking that, if the runabout repeated
the performance it had given at Krug’s Corner, he, and
Joe, and the car, stood a grave chance of being hung
up on the pilot of a locomotive.</p>

<p>Before he could disengage the clutch or give a kick at
the switch, one of the forward wheels struck a bowlder.
The car jumped, throwing McGlory out on one side and
Matt on the other.</p>

<p>As Matt fell, he caught at the two levers on the
right of the driver’s seat and clung to them desperately.
Although the car was running wild, with no
hand on the steering wheel, yet it bounded away along
the centre of the road, dragging Matt along with it.</p>

<p>With his elbows on the footboard, and the lower half
of his body trailing in the dust, Matt endeavored again
and again to get back on the running board and regain
a grip on the steering wheel.</p>

<p>A freight train was almost at the crossing. Unless
Matt could check the runabout in its wild flight, it would
surely be demolished by the locomotive or else hurl
itself to destruction against the sides of the swiftly
moving box cars.</p>

<p>The situation was desperate to the last degree. Unless
he could get hold of the steering wheel and regain his
seat, nothing could be done to avert the threatening catastrophe.
If he let go, and abandoned the runabout to
its fate, he was in danger of being thrown under the
racing wheels.</p>

<p>A demon of perversity seemed to possess the car and
to be bent upon the destruction of Matt King.</p>

<p>Again and again the young motorist tried to reach
the steering post with one hand and wriggled up onto
the running board. Each attempt was unsuccessful
until a lurch of the car helped in executing the manœuvre.</p>

<p>Hanging to the wheel, Matt threw himself over the
upright levers, dropped into the driver’s seat, disengaged
the clutch and jammed both brakes home.</p>

<p>Even then he was in doubt as to whether he would
succeed in stopping the car. If it continued mysteriously
to refuse control, there was certain destruction for
both Matt and the car against the side of the train,
the box cars of which were already flashing over the
crossing.</p>

<p>But the car stopped&mdash;stopped within a yard of the
rushing box cars!</p>

<p>Matt dared not throw in the reverse, fearing the
machine might move forward instead of backward, so
he dropped into the road and lay there, panting and
exhausted, while the freight rolled on.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">THE MANILA ENVELOPE.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Sufferin’ doom! I’m beginning to think Billy had
a bean on the right number, pard, when he said this
car would have to kill somebody before it settled down
and acted as though it was civilized.”</p>

<p>Matt looked up and saw his cowboy chum. McGlory
was rubbing a bruise on the side of his face and was
carrying the long manila envelope in his hand.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let the car go to blazes?” demanded
the cowboy. “What did you want to hang on to it for?
The best place for the blamed thing is the junk pile.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t let go without getting run over,” explained
Matt, rising to his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, you’d feel a heap more comfortable under a
pneumatic tire than you would under a train of box
cars!”</p>

<p>McGlory’s face was white, and his voice trembled.
The strain he had been under was just beginning to
tell on him.</p>

<p>“The owner of the runabout,” he went on, “showed
his good sense when he cut loose from it. The car’s
like a broncho, Matt, and you never can tell when its
fiendishness is going to break loose. If we had a keg
of powder, I’m a Piegan if I wouldn’t scatter that
sizz wagon all over this part of Long Island.”</p>

<p>McGlory glared savagely at the white, innocent-looking
machine.</p>

<p>The freight train had passed, and Matt was leaning
against the car and cudgeling his brains to think
of some reason for the runabout’s acting as it did.</p>

<p>“It brought us out of Krug’s Corner as nice as you
please,” he mused.</p>

<p>“Which is just the way it took us into Krug’s Corner,”
proceeded the cowboy. “That’s the way the pesky
thing works. First it lulls you into thinking it wouldn’t
side-step, or buck-jump, or do anything else that was
crooked or underhand for the world; then, when you
think you’re all right, the runabout hauls off and hands
you one. That’s the meanest kind of treachery&mdash;reaching
out the glad hand only to land on you with a
bunch of fives. There’s something human about that
car, Matt.”</p>

<p>“Inhuman, I should say,” muttered Matt. “Well, it’s
too much for me. Get in, Joe, and we’ll cross the track
to those trees over there and rest up a little before we
go on to the Malvern Country Club.”</p>

<p>“Damaged much, pard?”</p>

<p>“Jolted some, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Same here. I landed in the road like a thousand
of brick. This is my first experience with a crazy automobile,
and you can bet your moccasins it will be
the last. I didn’t know there was such a thing.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t,” said Matt. “How can you put together
a lot of machine and have anything but a senseless piece
of mechanism?”</p>

<p>“I’m by, when you pin me right down, pard, but if
this car isn’t locoed, then what’s the matter with it?”</p>

<p>“Something must go wrong.”</p>

<p>“Goes wrong and then fixes itself,” jeered the cowboy.
“If you’d look the blamed thing over this minute,
you wouldn’t be able to find anything out of order.”</p>

<p>Once more Matt started the car, and once more it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
acted like a sane and sensible machine, carrying the
boys to the shade of the trees and stopping obediently
to let them alight.</p>

<p>Matt flung himself down on the grass at the roadside
and examined his watch to ascertain whether it
had been injured. He found the timepiece in good condition.</p>

<p>“Ten-fifteen, Joe,” he observed, replacing the watch
in his vest and noticing that his chum was still carrying
the manila envelope in his hand as he sat down
beside him. “What are you holding that envelope for?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve gone off the jump myself, Matt,”
laughed McGlory. “It dropped out of my pocket when
I fell into the road. I picked it up, but have been too
badly rattled ever since to do anything but hold it in
my hand.”</p>

<p>McGlory was about to put it in his pocket when Matt
suggested that he examine the contents and see if he
could discover the name and address of the man who
owned the runabout.</p>

<p>The cowboy pulled out a couple of papers. Unfolding
one of them, he read some typewritten words and
gave a gasp and turned blank eyes on his chum.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” queried Matt.</p>

<p>“Listen to this,” was the answer. “‘Private Report
on the Pauper’s Dream Mine, by Hannibal J. Levitt,
Mining Engineer, of New York City.’ Wouldn’t that
rattle your spurs, Matt?” cried McGlory. “The syndicate
had an expert go out to Arizona and make an examination
of the ‘Pauper’s Dream,’&mdash;you remember the
colonel told me about that, in his letter. Here’s the report!
It drops into our hands by the queerest happen-chance
you ever heard of. Mister Man takes a header
from a crazy chug cart, unloads the machine onto you,
and then hustles for Krug’s, leaving the report behind.
He’s not at Krug’s when we get there, so the report
is left in our hands. This couldn’t have happened once
in a million times, pard!”</p>

<p>Matt was rubbing his bruised shins and allowing the
amazing event to drift through his brain. It was queer,
there was no mistake about it. In fact, all the experiences
of the boys that Thursday morning were on the
“queer” order.</p>

<p>“You say,” said Matt, “that the document is headed
‘Private Report.’ Why should it be a private report if
it is for the syndicate?”</p>

<p>“Private for the syndicate, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Hardly that, Joe. Unless there’s some skullduggery
that report ought to be public property&mdash;public enough
so that it could go into a prospectus. What’s the other
paper?”</p>

<p>McGlory opened the other document, and found it to
be a letter from Colonel Billings, dated nearly a month
previous.</p>

<p>“It’s a letter from the colonel, Matt,” the cowboy
announced, “and is addressed to Levitt. The colonel
says he will not pay Levitt the balance due until Levitt
sends him the private report on the ‘Pauper’s Dream’
proposition.”</p>

<p>“Great spark plugs!” exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>“What’s strange about that?” demanded McGlory. “If
Levitt made an examination of the property he certainly
expects pay for it.”</p>

<p>“But not from the colonel, Joe! Levitt was examining
the mine for the syndicate, and he’s not entitled
to any money from the colonel unless he’s doing shady
work of some kind.”</p>

<p>“Speak to me about that!” muttered McGlory. “It
looks as though we’d grabbed a live wire when we got
hold of this yellow envelope.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the way the business stacks up,” said
Matt earnestly. “The owner of this troublesome runabout
happens to be Hannibal J. Levitt, and he’s playing
an unscrupulous double game. Glance through that
report and give me the gist of it.”</p>

<p>Eagerly&mdash;and a little apprehensively&mdash;McGlory looked
through the private report. His face grew longer and
longer as he read.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ poorhouses!” he cried at last. “Levitt says,
in this report, that the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ isn’t a mine,
but a pocket, and that the pocket has been worked out.
In other words, pard, my hundred shares of stock are
worth just about what they’ll bring for scrap paper.
And the colonel had me worked up till I thought I was
going to be a millionaire! Riddle: Where was Moses
when the light went out?”</p>

<p>McGlory fell back on the grass and kicked up his
heels dejectedly.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see through the dodge your Tucson colonel
is working, Joe?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“Dodge?” echoed McGlory. “The ‘Pauper’s Dream’
is just a hole in the ground. We can’t any of us dodge
that.”</p>

<p>“The colonel,” went on Matt quietly, “is paying Levitt
to make a false report to the syndicate. To-night the
syndicate meets and decides whether or not it will buy
the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’ Levitt’s false report has already
been submitted, I suppose, and read. You show up at
the meeting with the two bars of bullion, and a sworn
statement from the colonel that they came out of the
ten-stamp mill on the ‘Dream’ during one week’s run.
That clinches the proposition. The syndicate, relying
on Levitt’s honesty, and, incidentally, on the colonel’s,
pay over a big sum for a worthless hole in the ground,
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The cowboy leaped erect, flushed and excited.</p>

<p>“And the colonel,” he cried, “divides the proceeds
among the stockholders! That gives me a big profit on
my five hundred. Oh, well, I reckon I’ve got my dipper
right side up during this rain.”</p>

<p>McGlory chuckled. Matt stared at him as though he
hardly believed what he heard.</p>

<p>“Pard,” said Matt quietly, “it’s a game of out-and-out
robbery.”</p>

<p>“That’s the syndicate’s lookout, not mine. If they
want to drop half a million into that hole in the ground,
what is it to me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you mean that, Joe,” said Matt, getting
up. “We’ll go on to the Malvern Country Club and
find out what Griggs has to say to you. We’ve got
plenty of time to figure the matter over before the Syndicate
meets to-night.”</p>

<p>Matt’s face was set and determined, and there was a
smouldering light in his gray eyes, which proved that
he had nerved himself for some duty which might be
disagreeable. McGlory was wrapped in thought&mdash;so
concerned in his own affairs that he forgot Matt, forgot
the treacherous nature of the runabout, forgot everything
but the “Pauper’s Dream” and his chances for
winning or losing a fortune.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V_THE_UNEXPECTED" id="CHAPTER_V_THE_UNEXPECTED">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="titlefont ">THE UNEXPECTED.</span></a></h2>


<p>The unexpected happened at least twice to the motor
boys between ten-thirty and eleven o’clock that Thursday
morning. First, they naturally expected to have
trouble with the runabout, but it carried out its work
handsomely and deposited them in the Malvern Country
Club garage at precisely five minutes of eleven.</p>

<p>There was not much talk between the boys during the
ride. McGlory was concerned with his “Pauper’s
Dream” reflections&mdash;and Matt had reflections of his own.
Besides his thoughts, which were none too agreeable,
Matt had to recall Billy’s instructions for finding the
way, and also to be on the alert for any sudden tantrum
on the part of the runabout. But the tantrum did not
develop, and the boys left the garage and made their
way across the broad lawn of the clubhouse to a porch
which extended along the front of the building.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see Mr. Joshua Griggs,” said McGlory to
a stout person wearing side-whiskers and knee breeches.
The servant looked the boys over.</p>

<p>“Wot nyme?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Matt King and Joe McGlory&mdash;two nymes.”</p>

<p>“’E’s hexpecting you. This w’y, please.”</p>

<p>The boys were ushered through a great apartment
with a beamed ceiling and a fireplace that covered half
of one end of the room, up a flight of broad stairs, and
along a wide hall. Here the servant paused by a door
and knocked. A mumble of voices, coming from the
other side of the door, ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>“What’s wanted?” demanded some one.</p>

<p>“Mr. McGlory hand friend, sir.”</p>

<p>“Send ’em in.”</p>

<p>The servant pushed open the door, drew to one side,
and bowed the boys out of the hall. Then the unexpected
happened for the second time.</p>

<p>There were two men in the room, and the atmosphere
was thick with tobacco smoke and a reek of liquor. A
box of cigars was on a table; also a decanter and two
glasses, a bowl of cracked ice, and a bottle of “fizz”
water.</p>

<p>A man was seated in a comfortable chair, rocking and
smoking. This man was Hannibal J. Levitt, owner of
the unmanageable runabout.</p>

<p>The other man was tall and gaunt. He wore a black
frock coat and gray trousers, a flowing tie, and a big
diamond in the front of his pleated white shirt. His
hair was a trifle long and a trifle thin on the crown. A
mustache spread widely from his upper lip; and a wisp
of pointed beard decorated his chin.</p>

<p>This latter individual exploded a hearty laugh as
McGlory recoiled and stared like a person in a trance.</p>

<p>“Howdy, son?” barked the man in the long coat,
sweeping down on the cowboy and seizing his hand.
“Something of a surprise, hey? Lookin’ for Griggs, by
gad, and you find me!”</p>

<p>“Colonel!” gulped McGlory. “Speak to me about this!
Why, I thought you were in Tucson?”</p>

<p>“Made up my mind at the last minute that I’d better
trek eastward and make sure the deal for the ‘Dream’
went through.” He slapped McGlory on the back. “A
fortune, my boy, for all of us, by gad! The ‘Dream’s’
a bonanza&mdash;gold from the grass roots down. But present
your friend; present your friend.”</p>

<p>The colonel turned beamingly toward Matt.</p>

<p>“My pard, Matt King,” said McGlory. “Everybody
has heard of him, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“You do me proud,” bubbled the colonel, seizing
Matt’s hand and pumping his arm up and down. “A
friend of McGlory’s is a friend of mine. Allow me”&mdash;and
he turned toward Levitt, only to find Levitt leaning
across the table, his jaws agape. “Well, well, well!”
mumbled the colonel. “What’s flagged you, Levitt?”</p>

<p>“We’ve met before,” grinned Levitt.</p>

<p>“How’s that?”</p>

<p>“These are the young fellows to whom I gave that
confounded runabout.”</p>

<p>“A conspiracy, by gad, to keep me from meeting McGlory!
How’d you expect him to get here in a motor
wagon you couldn’t run yourself?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know who the lads were, colonel, or I’d have
been more considerate. But”&mdash;and here he turned to
Matt&mdash;“how <em>did</em> you do it?”</p>

<p>“We had plenty of trouble with the machine,” said
Matt, “but we made it bring us.”</p>

<p>The situation was clearing. Levitt, at the time Matt
and McGlory had met him that morning, was also on
his way to the Malvern Country Club.</p>

<p>“Re-markable!” cooed the colonel. “But it’s a terrible
land for dust, ain’t it?” He poured something from the
decanter into the glasses. “Irrigate!” he said. “Advance
by file, my young friends, and refresh the inner
man.”</p>

<p>“None for me, colonel,” answered Matt, whose opinion
of the colonel was dropping by swift degrees.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I stack up, too, colonel,” grinned McGlory.</p>

<p>The colonel looked horrified.</p>

<p>“From Arizona, Joseph,” he murmured, “and you
won’t indulge? Ex-traordinary, I must say. Smoke?”
And he indicated the box of cigars.</p>

<p>“No, colonel,” declined Matt.</p>

<p>A sheepish look crossed McGlory’s face as he met the
colonel’s inquiring eye.</p>

<p>“I’m in line with my pard,” said he.</p>

<p>“Astounding!” gasped the colonel. “Both habits are
reprehensible&mdash;exceedingly so. I honor you highly, my
lads, but&mdash;ahem!&mdash;your shining example is one by which
I may not profit.” He turned to the mining engineer.
“The fire-water is before us, Levitt,” said he; “charge!”</p>

<p>Two hands gripped the glasses simultaneously, and a
gurgling followed. The colonel dried his lips elaborately
with a large yellow handkerchief.</p>

<p>“The day, Joseph,” he resumed, “is not far distant
when you can own a private yacht, a racing stable, an
imported car, and a lordly mansion. I have come personally
to New York to drive the business through and
clinch it. To-night we show the moneyed interests what
we’ve got up our wide and flowing sleeves. Half a million
in coin, my son, will rise to the bait like a speckled
trout to the alluring fly. But be seated, be seated; let’s
all be seated.”</p>

<p>Matt took a chair by an open window, and McGlory
dropped into another at a little distance.</p>

<p>“The telegram I received, colonel,” observed the cowboy,
“was signed ‘Joshua Griggs.’”</p>

<p>“Even so, my dear youth,” smiled the colonel, lowering
himself into a chair and lifting his feet to the top of
the table. “Mr. Griggs lives in Hempstead. I am enjoying
his hospitality, and he has put me up at this most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
delightful club. I arrived yesterday afternoon, and I
yearned to clasp your honest palm before we met in
Liberty Street to-night. Incidentally, I will relieve you
of further responsibility in the matter of the bullion. Being
somewhat fatigued after my long and arduous railroad
journey, the Syndicate meeting was put off. To-night,
however, we shall be there; and to-night, my son,
we put our fortunes to the touch.”</p>

<p>The colonel was altogether too loquacious to suit Matt&mdash;too
fluent and insincere. That he was entirely capable
of engineering a huge swindle Matt felt sure. And Matt
regretted to note that the colonel exerted a powerful
influence over McGlory.</p>

<p>“Is this deal for the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ on the level,
colonel?” inquired the cowboy.</p>

<p>A lighted bomb, suddenly dropped in front of the colonel
and Levitt, would not have caused more consternation.
The colonel’s feet fell from the table with a bang,
and the mining engineer once more threw himself half-way
across the table top.</p>

<p>There followed a period of silence. The colonel, after
an odd look at Levitt, was first to speak.</p>

<p>“McGlory,” said he, “you are my friend, and I would
take a good deal from a friend. Has my integrity ever
been questioned? Have you any reason to believe that
this mining deal is not on the level?”</p>

<p>“Shucks!” deprecated McGlory. “Is the syndicate
anxious to buy a pocket that’s been worked out? Have
they got so much money, these Syndicate fellows, that
they want to drop some of it into a mine that’s a ‘dream’
in more senses of the word than one?”</p>

<p>This was another bomb. Levitt went white, and
breathed hard. Colonel Billings drew a deep breath,
studied McGlory’s face, and then looked at the ceiling.
Then once more he was first to speak.</p>

<p>“My son,” said he, “you talk like a buck ’Pache with
more tizwin aboard than is good for him. And yet you
must be in your sober senses. What are your grounds
for expressing yourself in that&mdash;er&mdash;preposterous manner?
I wait to learn!”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the cowboy, “when Levitt took his
header from that runabout of his, on the Jericho Pike, a
long yellow envelope dropped from his pocket&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I breathe again!” interjected the colonel. “You
found it, McGlory?”</p>

<p>“That’s the size of it.”</p>

<p>“And you read the contents of that yellow envelope?”</p>

<p>“Matt and I wanted to find out the name of the man
who owned the runabout. That’s how we happened to
read the ‘private report.’ It wasn’t good reading,
colonel.”</p>

<p>“It was for private perusal by the inner circle, my
son,” said the colonel. “Levitt and I were vastly worried
over the loss of that report. I will trouble you for
it, my boy.”</p>

<p>The colonel reached out his hand. McGlory took the
envelope from his pocket, and was about to pass it over
when Matt reached forward and caught it from his
fingers.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Matt, “but I was the one
who found this envelope. I gave it to Joe when I threw
off my coat, east of Krug’s Corner, to tinker with the
runabout. I am going to take care of it.”</p>

<p>All four were on their feet&mdash;Matt determined, McGlory
puzzled and bewildered, the colonel wrathful, and
Levitt with a dangerous gleam in his eyes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_A_DIFFERENCE_OF_OPINION" id="CHAPTER_VI_A_DIFFERENCE_OF_OPINION">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="titlefont ">A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Well, by gad!” exclaimed the colonel, realizing suddenly
what sort of a lad he had to deal with in Matt
King.</p>

<p>“What’s that for, pard?” inquired McGlory.</p>

<p>“It don’t belong to you, or to McGlory, or to any one
but me!” said Levitt. “If you try to keep that document,
King, you’re nothing more nor less than a thief.”</p>

<p>The red ran into Matt’s face.</p>

<p>“Softly, softly,” breathed the colonel. “This talk of
thieves, Levitt, is a little premature. Matt King is a
friend of McGlory’s, and he could not be that if there
was any yellow streak in his nature. No, by gad! We
are all gentlemen here. King, sir, if that manila envelope
contains papers belonging to our mutual friend,
Levitt, you will return them to him, will you not?”</p>

<p>“After a while,” said Matt; “not immediately.”</p>

<p>The colonel seemed thunderstruck.</p>

<p>“You hear?” muttered Levitt, between his teeth.
“He’s trying to play double with us, Billings! Those
papers mean a whole lot to me, and I’m going to have
them!”</p>

<p>The colonel’s mood underwent a change. Attempts at
conciliation having failed, there now remained nothing
but vigorous action. His first move was to pass rapidly
to the door, turn a key in the lock, and drop the key
into his pocket. Then he once more approached Matt.</p>

<p>“May I inquire, young man,” he bristled, “what you
mean by this most remarkable conduct?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to protect Joe and myself,” Matt answered.</p>

<p>“Protect? Protect yourself and Joe against what, in
Heaven’s name?”</p>

<p>“Against being drawn into a criminal act by you and
Levitt, and being compelled to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>“He talks like a fool!” snapped the mining engineer.</p>

<p>“He is misinformed, that’s all,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“I’m not misinformed,” went on Matt sturdily. “These
New York capitalists hired Levitt to go to Arizona and
investigate the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’ He made two reports,
one private and the other for the members of the Syndicate.
One says the mine is no good, and the other,
of course, gives it a glittering recommendation.”</p>

<p>“How do you know,” asked Levitt, his voice shaking
with anger, “that the Syndicate’s report is different from
the other?”</p>

<p>“Because Colonel Billings is paying you for making
it,” replied Matt. “Would the colonel give you good
money for handing that private report over to the Syndicate?
Hardly. Colonel Billings is here to sell the
mine.”</p>

<p>“How do you know Billings is paying me anything?”</p>

<p>“He has already paid you a little, and you came out
here this morning to receive the rest of it. If that crazy
runabout of yours hadn’t interfered, you’d have been
able to turn the private report over to the colonel, and no
one would ever have been the wiser.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all this?” Levitt’s voice was
husky.</p>

<p>“There was a letter from the colonel in the envelope
along with the report.”</p>

<p>“By gad!” Billings whirled on the mining engineer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
“You don’t mean to say, Levitt,” he asked, “that you had
so little sense as to keep that letter of mine?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I keep it? It was the only thing in
the way of an agreement that I had with you.”</p>

<p>“Then”&mdash;and the colonel tossed his hands&mdash;“that lets
in the search light on the two of us.”</p>

<p>“And we’ve caught a tartar in this meddling young
whelp,” ground out Levitt, waving his hand toward
Matt.</p>

<p>“He’s an intelligent youth, Levitt,” declared the colonel,
“and amenable to reason. Let me talk with him.
My dear young man,” said the colonel to Matt, “assuming
that what you say about the report is true, in what
way are you legally liable through association with
Levitt and myself?”</p>

<p>“You’re trying to swindle a company of New York
capitalists,” answered Matt, “and Joe and I, not knowing
the deal was crooked, have already been dragged
into it. If we allowed the plot to go on we would be
equally guilty with you and Levitt, and we could be
arrested and sent to prison.”</p>

<p>A tolerant smile crossed the colonel’s face.</p>

<p>“Suppose I assure you that there is not the remotest
possibility of any of us going to prison,” said he; “will
you give up that report and letter?”</p>

<p>Matt hesitated, not because his determination was
wavering, but because he wanted to put his thoughts in
the right words.</p>

<p>“It means a fortune to McGlory,” urged the colonel;
“and what kind of a fellow are you to euchre a friend
out of a fortune?”</p>

<p>“It’s not an honest fortune,” declared Matt, “and Joe
can’t afford to accept it. Besides, what good would it
do him if he found himself in the penitentiary for obtaining
money under false pretenses?”</p>

<p>The colonel was beginning to lose patience.</p>

<p>“You’ve got less sense than any cub of your years
I ever met up with!” he cried irritably. “How much
money do you want for that report and letter? That’s
your play, I reckon; and I’d rather shell out a hundred
or two than have any trouble with you. How much do
I bleed?”</p>

<p>The colonel measured Matt with wrathful and inquiring
eyes.</p>

<p>“You haven’t money enough to buy me!” declared
Matt.</p>

<p>“Aw, cut it short!” broke in Levitt savagely. “What’s
the use of fooling with him any longer?</p>

<p>“Wait!” cautioned the colonel. “McGlory,” he went
on, to the cowboy, “what do you mean by lugging such
a two-faced longhorn into a private and important council
like this?”</p>

<p>“You’re wide of your trail, colonel,” said McGlory,
with spirit. “There’s nothing two-faced about Matt
King, and you can spread your blankets and go to sleep
on that. He’s the clear quill from spurs to sombrero,
and the best pard that ever rode sign with me. Don’t
you make any mistake in taking his sizing.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is he trying to rope down and tie your
bright prospects for?”</p>

<p>“He’s got more sense in a minute than I have in a
year, and you can bet your boot straps he knows what
he’s doing&mdash;even if I don’t.”</p>

<p>“You’re far wide of your trail, Joseph. Matt King is
committing an illegal act this minute. He has property
belonging to Levitt and refuses to give it up. He could
be jailed for a thief. But we’re not going to jail him.
We’ll just take that report and letter from him.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll have to walk over me to do it, colonel!”
asserted McGlory.</p>

<p>“By gad!” muttered the colonel. “You’ve got as little
sense as he has.”</p>

<p>“Brainwork never was my long suit, but I’ve seen
enough of Pard Matt to feel safe in banking on any
notion that he bats up to me.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” gibed the colonel. “I’ll talk with you later,
McGlory, and take pains to show you the error of your
way. As for Matt King, he’s a false friend. He’s jealous
because you’re about to come into a fortune, and
he’s doing all he can to shift the cut and leave you
stranded.”</p>

<p>“That’s not true!” said Matt. “Joe knows me better
than that.”</p>

<p>“Sure I do, pard. Come on, and let’s get out of here.”</p>

<p>The actions of the two men were threatening. McGlory
started toward the door; but happened to remember
that it was locked, and that the colonel had the key
in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Cough up the key, colonel,” said the cowboy. “Don’t
force me to yell and have up that fellow with the knee
pants and the lilocks.”</p>

<p>“It will be better for you youngsters,” growled the
colonel, “if you don’t raise a commotion. The surest
way to see the inside of a lockup is by calling for help.
Are you going to hand over those papers?” And he
turned to Matt. “Last call.”</p>

<p>“I’ll return them,” said Matt, “but not till after that
meeting to-night.”</p>

<p>He slipped the manila envelope into the breast of his
coat. Having planned what he considered was the best
move, the young motorist was never more resolute in
seeking to carry it out. Even though he was retaining
Levitt’s property, yet right and justice upheld him in
doing so.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter,” murmured Levitt, his eyes flaming,
“he’s intending to take that private report to the Syndicate
meeting to-night! If he does&mdash;&mdash;” He gulped
on his words, finishing with a significant glance at Billings.</p>

<p>Matt was wondering how he and McGlory could get
out of the room without making too much of a scene.
He understood very well that the colonel could inaugurate
a pursuit, in case he and his chum succeeded in
getting away with the envelope and its contents, and
that, for a time at least, any story the colonel and
Levitt chose to tell would be accepted. Temporary advantage
was all on the side of the colonel and the mining
engineer.</p>

<p>“He won’t show that paper at the meeting, Levitt,”
gritted the colonel, now thoroughly aroused. “We’re
done fooling with him.”</p>

<p>He stepped toward Matt from one side, while Levitt
advanced from the other. The cowboy tried to push
closer to his chum, but the colonel held him back. One
of the colonel’s hands went groping in the direction
of a hip pocket. Matt guessed what the hand was after.</p>

<p>“The window, Joe!” he called.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the words, the king of the motor
boys whirled, pushed through the window, lowered himself
swiftly from the sill, and dropped.</p>

<p>The colonel grabbed at the hands on the sill, but they
pulled out from under his gripping fingers; then, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
downward, he saw the lithe, agile form of Matt
King lift itself from a flower bed and fade from sight
around a corner of the building.</p>

<p>Two young fellows with golf sticks were crossing the
lawn and had witnessed Matt’s drop from the window.
Naturally they were surprised at the peculiar proceeding
and stood looking up at the colonel.</p>

<p>“Catch him!” bawled the colonel; “he’s a thief!”</p>

<p>That was enough. The two members of the Country
Club darted away after Matt.</p>

<p>McGlory was making preparations to drop from the
other window, but the colonel grabbed him at the critical
moment and forced him into a chair.</p>

<p>“Off with you, Levitt!” the colonel called. “You can
catch that young cub! And when you do overhaul him
get the report and the letter at any cost.”</p>

<p>As he finished the colonel flung the door key toward
the engineer. The latter let himself out of the room
and bounded excitedly down the stairs.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">AN OLD FRIEND.</span></a></h2>


<p>Matt hoped that McGlory would be able to follow
him; but, if the cowboy found this to be impossible,
then Matt would do his best to prevent the report from
falling into the hands of the colonel and Levitt. That
report was the one thing of vital importance. On it
alone hinged the success or failure of the colonel’s gigantic
swindling operations. Matt must escape capture
at any cost, in order to retain possession of the report.</p>

<p>The course of his flight carried him toward the rear
of the Country Club grounds. He heard the colonel’s
shout to the young men just in from the golf links, and
he knew there would be a pursuit. Of course Matt could
explain the situation and perhaps escape legal complications,
but if caught he would be compelled to give up
the report.</p>

<p>He darted across a tennis court, leaped the net, dodged
behind a clump of lilac bushes, and ran toward the edge
of a grove that bordered the Country Club grounds on
that side. Between the lilacs and the grove was a rustic
pavilion. A flower bed was near the pavilion, and an
old negro was kneeling beside the bed, his back toward
Matt, and industriously pulling weeds. Matt had not
much time to give to the negro, but hoped that he was
giving his whole attention to his work. As he came
around the pavilion Matt heard sounds which indicated
that more pursuers were after him&mdash;these coming from
the direction of the garage and the stables.</p>

<p>To reach the timber without being seen seemed hopeless,
and Matt looked hurriedly around for some place
in which he could secrete himself.</p>

<p>The floor of the pavilion was elevated some two feet
or more above the surface of the ground. The opening
between the floor and the ground was filled in with
panels of close latticework. One of the panels was
broken, and Matt dropped to his knees and crawled
through it.</p>

<p>This was not as secure a hiding place as he would
have selected, if he could have had his choice, but his
emergency was such that he had no time to look farther.</p>

<p>Lying flat on the ground, so that his form would not
be visible to his pursuers, Matt watched and waited.</p>

<p>The two young men with the golf sticks broke into
view around the lilac bushes. They were closely followed
by three others, employees of the club, evidently,
for they wore overclothes. Matt recognized one of
them as having been in the garage when he and McGlory
left the runabout there.</p>

<p>The old negro had lifted himself to his feet and was
facing the five pursuers. Freedom or capture for Matt
depended upon what the old negro knew. Scarcely
breathing, the king of the motor boys listened for what
was to come.</p>

<p>“Say, uncle,” panted one of the young men from the
links, “did you see a fellow running this way?”</p>

<p>“Ah did, suh,” replied the negro. “Ah was as close
tuh him as whut me an’ yo’ is, boss.”</p>

<p>Levitt at that instant rushed around the bushes. He
was in time to hear the negro’s answer to the question.</p>

<p>“Which way did he go?” Levitt demanded. “He’s a
thief, and we’ve got to capture him and recover some
stolen property. Which way did he run? Quick!”</p>

<p>The old darky turned and deliberately pointed away
from the pavilion and to a point in the encompassing
timber which led toward the road, well to the north of
the clubhouse.</p>

<p>“Dat’s de way he went, boss,” said he, “an’, by golly,
he went jess a-hummin’.”</p>

<p>“This way, men!” shouted Levitt, leaping off in the
direction indicated by the negro.</p>

<p>The six pursuers disappeared at a run, and left Matt
gasping with astonishment. Why had the old darky
put them on the wrong track? It was preposterous to
think that the negro had himself been deceived.</p>

<p>While Matt was turning the matter over in his mind,
and puzzling his brain with it, the negro began to
whistle softly and to limp in the direction of the pavilion.
On reaching the broken panel of latticework,
he leaned against the railing of the pavilion.</p>

<p>“How yo’ lak dat, Marse Matt?” he chuckled.
“Didn’t Ah done send um on de wrong track, huh? En
yo’ all thought Ah wasn’t lookin’ at yo’, en dat Ah
didn’t know who yo’ was! Har, har, har!”</p>

<p>The darky laughed softly as he finished talking.</p>

<p>Matt’s wonderment continued to grow.</p>

<p>“Great spark plugs!” he muttered, recognizing an old
acquaintance. “Is it&mdash;can it be&mdash;Uncle Tom?”</p>

<p>“Dat’s who Ah is, marse! Hit’s been a right sma’t
of er while since Ah had de pleasuah ob seein’ yo’. De
las’ time we was togedder was in Denvah. ’Membah
all dem excitin’ times we had in Arizony, dat time dat
Topsy gal en me was wif dat Uncle Tom’s Cabin
comp’ny? Golly, I ain’t nevah gwineter fo’git dat!
Who’s been doin’ yo’ mascottin’ lately, huh? ’Pears lak
no one had, f’om de ha’d luck yo’ is in.”</p>

<p>Matt recalled Uncle Tom very vividly. The aged
negro had belonged to a stranded company of players,
and Matt had helped them out of their difficulties. But
that had happened in the Southwest, and here was Uncle
Tom about as far East as he could get. The world
is not so large, after all, and many strange and unexpected
meetings occur.</p>

<p>“I’m more surprised than I can tell, Uncle Tom,” said
Matt, “to run across you, here on Long Island, and at
a time when I certainly needed a friend. It may be
that you can help me even more, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah’s pinin’ tuh do all dat Ah can fo’ yo’, Marse
Matt,” interposed the darky earnestly.</p>

<p>“But,” went on Matt, “this is hardly a safe place for
me. If the coast is clear I guess I’d better crawl out
and get into the woods.”</p>

<p>“Yo’s right erbout dat, marse. Ah’s so plumb tickled
tuh see yo’ dat I come mighty nigh fo’gittin’ yo’s bein’
hunted fo’. Wait twell Ah take er look erroun’.”</p>

<p>Uncle Tom stepped away from the pavilion and swept
a keen glance over the grounds in that vicinity.</p>

<p>“De coast am cleah, Marse Matt,” he announced, returning
to the side of the pavilion. “Yo come out an’
hike fo’ de woods, en Ah’ll foller yuh. Den we can
talk a li’l, en you can tell me whut mo’ de ole man can
do.”</p>

<p>Matt pushed through the broken lattice and gained
the timber line at a point opposite the place where his
pursuers had vanished. Here, for a time, he was safe,
and he sank down behind a mask of brush. Uncle Tom
was not long in reaching his side.</p>

<p>“Golly,” he beamed, looking Matt over, “but hit’s good
fo’ sore eyes jess tuh see yo’, marse. Ah nevah expected
nuffin’ lak dis. Mouty peculiah how folks meets
up wif one anotheh sometimes, dat-er-way.”</p>

<p>“How did you happen to wander in this direction,
Uncle Tom?” Matt asked.</p>

<p>“Mascottin’,” answered the old man gravely. “Ah
be’n mascottin’ fo’ er prize fighteh. Terry, de Cricket, is
whut he called himse’f, en Ah won a fight fo’ him in
Denvah, en another in Kansas City; but in New Yawk
Terry, de Cricket, done ’spected me tuh do all de wo’k,
en he went down wif er chirp, en dey counted ten on
him. Ah couldn’t help dat, but Terry he ’low Ah was
losin’ mah mascottin’ ability, en he turned me loose.
Topsy done got er job in er house in Hempstead, en
Ah picked up dis place at de Country Club. But Ah
doan’ like hit, marse. Ah’s er ole man, en hit’s backachin’
wo’k. Yo’ needs er mascot bad, en now’s de time
tuh take me on.”</p>

<p>Uncle Tom was a humorous old rascal, and professed
to believe that he possessed mystical powers as a luck
bringer. He declared that he had helped Matt, and
Matt humored him by letting him think so, giving him
a few dollars now and then to help him keep body and
soul together.</p>

<p>“I’m not in shape just now, Uncle Tom,” said Matt,
“to hire a private mascot of your abilities. You see, I’m
mixed up in a bit of trouble that I’ve got to work
through alone.”</p>

<p>“Bymby, Marse Matt, mebby yo’ all can make er place
fo’ Uncle Tom?” pleaded the negro. “Jess remembah
whut Ah’s done fo’ yo’ in de past. Ah nevah mascotted
fo’ anybody dat Ah liked so well as yo’se’f. Dat’s right.
Has yo’ got a dollah yo’ can let go of wifout material
damage to yo’ own welfare?”</p>

<p>Matt extracted a five-dollar bill from his pocket and
pushed it into the negro’s yellow palm. Uncle Tom’s
gratitude was so intense it was almost morbid.</p>

<p>“Yo’s de fines’ fellah dat evah was,” he declared,
grabbing Matt’s hand and hanging to it. “Dat’s de
trufe. Ah’d raddah wo’k fo’ you fo’ nuffin dan fo’ some
odders fo’ er millyun dollahs er day. Dat’s right. Yo’s
de same ole Marse Matt, en yo’&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much time to talk, Uncle Tom,” interrupted
Matt. “When I left the clubhouse I had to drop from
a second-story window. I made it all right, but I left a
friend behind. My friend’s name is Joe McGlory. Do
you think you could get word to him?”</p>

<p>“Shuah Ah can!” replied the old negro promptly.
“What kin’ ob a lookin’ fellah is dat ’ar Joe McGlory?”</p>

<p>Matt described his chum’s appearance, and the darky
listened closely.</p>

<p>“Find out,” Matt finished, “whether McGlory is still
upstairs in the clubhouse. If he is I don’t suppose you
can communicate with him, for you will have to do it
privately. Providing you can get word to him, tell him
to meet me in the grove at the roadside, a quarter of a
mile north of the clubhouse. Got that?”</p>

<p>“Yas, I done got dat, marse.”</p>

<p>“If you can’t get word to McGlory inside of an hour,
then you come and tell me, will you?”</p>

<p>“Yo’ knows, Marse Matt, yo’ can count on Uncle
Tom. Ah’ll do whut yo’ say, en Ah’ll wo’k mah ole haid
off mascottin’ fo’ yo’ while Ah’m doin’ it.”</p>

<p>The old darky slipped away through the edge of the
timber, and Matt, none too sanguine, proceeded to lay
a course for the spot where he hoped to be joined by
his cowboy chum.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">THE COLONEL TRIES PERSUASION.</span></a></h2>


<p>For a few moments McGlory struggled in the grasp
of Colonel Billings. He was excited, and angry over
the way Matt had been treated, and he would not have
hesitated to do the colonel an injury if he could thereby
have escaped from the room and followed his pard.</p>

<p>“Quiet!” ordered the colonel sternly. “You don’t understand
this thing, McGlory, or you wouldn’t be fighting
to escape from me. I’m the best friend you ever
had, if you only knew it.”</p>

<p>“Nary, you ain’t!” panted the cowboy. “My best
friend just risked his neck dropping out of the window.
You’re trying to get me into trouble, and Pard Matt is
trying to keep me out. Take your hands off me, colonel!”</p>

<p>“I will, Joe, just as soon as you promise to sit still
and hear what I have to say.”</p>

<p>McGlory reflected that it was too late to follow Matt,
who was probably doing his best to evade Levitt and
the others who were hot on his trail. The cowboy reasoned
that he could find his chum later, and that there
could be no harm in listening to what the colonel had
to say.</p>

<p>“Go on,” said he curtly.</p>

<p>“You’ll stay right where you are until I’m done?”
asked the colonel.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Billings drew back, dropped into a chair, and laid a
friendly hand on the cowboy’s knee. His voice changed,
sounding the depths of friendly interest and personal
regard.</p>

<p>“Joe,” he remarked, “ever since your father took the
One-way Trail I’ve sort of felt that I was responsible
for your welfare. I knew your father mighty well&mdash;better
than any one else in Tucson, I reckon&mdash;and him
and me was bosom friends.”</p>

<p>McGlory had no personal knowledge on this point, but
he was willing to take the colonel’s word for it.</p>

<p>“If I can do anything for Joe,” the colonel went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
“I says to myself that I won’t leave a stone unturned to
do it. When the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ proposition came under
my management I knew I had the chance I wanted
to turn your way. I sold you a hundred shares of the
stock at five dollars a share, and we went on to develop
the claim.”</p>

<p>“And there wasn’t any more gold in the shaft,” spoke
up the cowboy dryly, “than there was in a New England
well.”</p>

<p>“That’s what everybody thought,” returned the colonel,
“but I knew better.”</p>

<p>He got up, went to the table, and helped himself to
a drink from the decanter.</p>

<p>“Better have a nip, son, eh?” he asked, as by an
afterthought, before leaving the table.</p>

<p>“Not for me,” replied McGlory stoutly. “Pard Matt
don’t believe in that sort of thing, and I get along
better when I make his notions my own. I’ve found
that out more than once.”</p>

<p>The colonel sighed resignedly, but did not press the
point. Returning to his chair, he continued his persuasions.</p>

<p>“I knew when I sold you that stock that there was a
reef of rich gold ore under the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’ I
didn’t want it found until the right minute. Those who
had bought stock in the claim got scared. Some of
them sold their stock back to me for a song. When I’d
got enough of the stock to give me a controlling interest
<em>I found the gold vein</em>.”</p>

<p>“That was a double play,” said McGlory bluntly.
“There wasn’t anything fair about that, colonel.”</p>

<p>“It was all fair. Some of the stockholders were trying
to freeze me out. By letting them think there wasn’t
any gold in the ‘Dream’ I turned the tables and froze
<em>them</em> out. It was simply a game of diamond cut diamond&mdash;and
I was a little too sharp for my enemies.
That was all right, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>McGlory thought the colonel had a fair excuse for
acting as he had done.</p>

<p>“When we laid open that gold vein,” pursued the
colonel, “buyers flocked around the ‘Pauper’s Dream’
like crows around a cornfield. They wanted to buy.
I saw a chance to deal with this New York syndicate
for big money, so I had the syndicate send out an expert
to examine our property. Levitt came. I asked
him to make out a true report for the syndicate and a
private, false report for&mdash;other uses.”</p>

<p>McGlory opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“I see I’ve got you guessing,” laughed the colonel
gently. “This is how that private report came to be
made out&mdash;that private report on which your misguided
friend has built such a fabric of unjust suspicions. The
men I had frozen out of the company began to threaten
legal proceedings. The proceedings wouldn’t have
amounted to that”&mdash;and the colonel snapped his fingers&mdash;“for
those fellows hadn’t a leg to stand on; but do
you know what they could have done? Why, they’d
have tied up the mine for a year or two and prevented
the sale to the syndicate. In order to get around that
I hired Levitt to make out that fake report, and leave
it where those soreheads could see it. Now my hands
are free. The sale can be made to the syndicate, and
we’ll all win a fortune&mdash;providing your misguided friend
doesn’t take that cock-and-bull story of his to the meeting
to-night.“</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you explain the matter to the syndicate,
colonel, just as you have to me?” asked the cowboy.</p>

<p>“I could, yes; but they’d shy off. A little thing like
that sometimes knocks a big deal galley-west. It’s best
not to let any intimation of that fake report reach the
ears of the syndicate until we have the syndicate’s money
safely in our clothes. Young King means well&mdash;I’ll
give him credit for that&mdash;but he’s shy a couple of chips
this hand, and if he butts in we’re going to be left out
in the cold. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you explain this to Matt?”</p>

<p>“The explanation is for our own stockholders, and not
for outsiders. A word, a whisper might leak through
and reach the fellows who could block the deal. We
mustn’t allow that. My boy, my boy”&mdash;and here the
colonel became very gentle, very fatherly&mdash;“I’m doing
the best I can for you. I’m trying to hand you a fortune,
and you’ve got to help me&mdash;in spite of Pard Matt.
It’s your duty to help me. You’ll never have such a
chance to pick out a brownstone front on Easy Street,
and you mustn’t let the opportunity slip through your
fingers.”</p>

<p>To say that Joe McGlory was not influenced by the
colonel’s words would be to say that he was not human.
The cowboy wanted money, not for its own sake, but for
the great things he felt he could do with it. Not the
least of the cowboy’s desires was to help Matt in some
of his far-reaching aims in the motor field. He accepted
Billings’ story, and he reached out and gripped
his hand heartily.</p>

<p>“I’m with you, chaps, taps, and latigoes!” he exclaimed.
“But say, can’t I tell Pard Matt? If he
knew&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But the colonel was afraid of “Pard Matt.” The
king of the motor boys had a brain altogether too keen.</p>

<p>“Not a word, not a syllable,” adjured Billings. “All
that I have said, Joe, you must keep under your hat&mdash;until
after the meeting to-night and until after the
‘Dream’ is sold. You must buckle in and help me and
let Matt think what he will. Afterward, when the
money is divided, you can show Pard Matt where he
was wrong, and he’ll be glad to think that he did not
interfere with us in our work.”</p>

<p>“But he’s going to interfere,” murmured McGlory.
“Whenever Matt King sets out to do a thing he does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it. That’s his style. He’s got the fake report, and he’ll
use it at the meeting to-night&mdash;thinking he’s doing me
a good turn.”</p>

<p>“I believe that Levitt will catch him,” asserted the
colonel.</p>

<p>“You don’t know my pard as well as I do,” returned
the cowboy dejectedly. “I wonder if I couldn’t&mdash;&mdash;”
McGlory paused.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t what?” urged the colonel.</p>

<p>“Never mind now. I’m going out and see if I can’t
do something.”</p>

<p>Billings stared steadily at the lad for a moment.</p>

<p>“All right,” said he, “go and do what you can. Remember
I have confidence in you, and you’re not to
breathe a word regarding what we have talked about.
I shall have to get to New York before three o’clock.
The bank closes then, and I’ve got to get that bullion.
I’ll have to start in a fast car by one. Come back and
report to me before I leave.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it,” replied the cowboy, hurrying out of the
room.</p>

<p>The colonel chuckled, threw himself back in a chair,
and lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>“Easy, easy, easy!” he muttered. “I can wrap McGlory
around my fingers and not half try. Now, if
King is captured, and if I can be sure he won’t meddle
with me to-night, everything will be serene.”</p>

<p>The resourceful colonel accepted his worries calmly.
He had too much dignity to take part in a foot race,
so he remained in a comfortable chair by the window
and waited for news.</p>

<p>McGlory was back in ten minutes. His face was
glowing.</p>

<p>“Matt King dodged Levitt and all the rest who were
trailing him,” he reported.</p>

<p>“What!” The colonel arose excitedly from his seat.</p>

<p>“Don’t fret, colonel,” grinned the cowboy, “it’s not so
bad as that. An old darky who works around the club
grounds helped Matt make his getaway. Matt asked
him to tell me to meet him in the woods at the roadside,
a quarter of a mile north. That’s where I’m going
now. You’ll hear from me before one o’clock, colonel.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” rapped out the colonel.</p>

<p>“Something that will make the deal a sure go. I
haven’t time to talk much. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios</i>, for now.”</p>

<p>McGlory was away again like a shot, leaving the
colonel wondering&mdash;and fretting a little.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Levitt came gloomily into the
room.</p>

<p>“That young cub gave us the slip,” said he savagely,
“and I never had such a run in my life. The fat’s in
the fire, Billings.”</p>

<p>“Not so, my friend,” returned the colonel, his quick
wit grasping something that looked like an opportunity.
“Can you get hold of a man who will help you? Are
you acquainted with any one about the club grounds
who can be trusted to do a little brisk work and then
keep quiet about it?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. The man in the garage is known to me,
and he’s out for anything that’s got a dollar in it. But
what of it?”</p>

<p>The colonel’s plan was based on the information just
communicated to him by McGlory. He went into the
matter swiftly, but exhaustively, and when he had done
the gloom had vanished from Levitt’s face.</p>

<p>“It will work, it will work,” murmured the mining
engineer, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>“Then go and work it,” said the colonel briskly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX_WHAT_AILS_MGLORY" id="CHAPTER_IX_WHAT_AILS_MGLORY">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="titlefont ">WHAT AILS M’GLORY?</span></a></h2>


<p>Matt King, in a clump of bushes a quarter of a mile
north of the Malvern Country Club, watched the road
and waited for his chum. He had not much hope that
McGlory would join him, for he believed that the cowboy
would be held a prisoner by the colonel.</p>

<p>What Matt was doing, in this particular matter, was
all for his friend. McGlory had become entangled with
a gang of confidence men, who were playing boldly for
big stakes. Whether the dishonest game won out or
failed, Joe McGlory must have nothing to do with it.
If he profited by the crime he would be called on to
suffer at the hands of the law; and, even if the law
never reached him, his conscience would make him miserable
all his life for the part he had played in such
a huge swindling scheme.</p>

<p>Matt, at any cost to himself, meant to keep McGlory
clear of Billings and his criminal work. What is a
friend for if not to stand shoulder to shoulder with a
chum and save his good name? This touched upon one
of Matt’s principles&mdash;one of his rules of conduct long
ago formulated and steadily adhered to. And it was
a code which had played a big part in his many successes.</p>

<p>Minute after minute slipped away, and then Matt’s
heart bounded as he heard a crunch of footsteps around
a turn in the wooded road. It might be Uncle Tom
who was coming, however, with a report of his failure
to deliver the message to McGlory. Peering through
the bushes, hoping against hope, Matt’s fears suddenly
subsided and an expression of thankfulness escaped his
lips.</p>

<p>McGlory was coming!</p>

<p>Matt gave a low whistle. The cowboy answered it,
and was soon at his friend’s side, gripping his hands.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, old chap!” exclaimed McGlory. “I’d
like to see the gang that could lay <em>you</em> by the heels when
you make up your mind to get away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“You saw Uncle Tom, then?”</p>

<p>“Sure, or I shouldn’t be here. Old Ebony-face thinks
you’re about the whole works, from the way he talks.
A lot of queer things have happened to-day, but the
queerest is your meeting Uncle Tom in this out-of-the-way
corner of Long Island.”</p>

<p>“Wrong, Joe. The queerest&mdash;and the best&mdash;thing
that’s happened is the way we picked up that private
report of Levitt’s. We have to thank the crazy runabout
for that.”</p>

<p>McGlory, although of a different opinion on that
point since listening to the colonel’s persuasions, did not
allow Matt to think that he disagreed with him.</p>

<p>“How did you make it?” the cowboy asked. “Uncle
Tom didn’t tell me much about that. Principally he
worked his bazoo letting me know what a great mascot
he was, and how he used to pull luck your way down in
Arizona.”</p>

<p>Matt, briefly as he could, told about the pavilion in
the rear of the club grounds, and how Uncle Tom had
sent his pursuers on the wrong track.</p>

<p>McGlory laughed delightedly. He was playing a
part with an important point in view, and it was necessary
to pull the wool over Matt’s eyes. A despicable
part it was, for one who had benefited at Matt’s hands
as had McGlory; but the cowboy was filled with the
colonel’s specious arguments and crafty explanations,
and believed that, when the dust of the affair had settled,
and Matt knew everything, he would thank his cowboy
chum for preventing him from making a big mistake.</p>

<p>“The colonel is a schemer, Joe,” declared Matt.</p>

<p>“You bet your spurs he is,” chuckled McGlory.
“That’s the way they raise ’em out in Tucson. The
only way to keep a fellow from getting ahead of you is
to get ahead of him first.”</p>

<p>Matt did not approve of these sentiments, nor of the
hearty admiration the cowboy seemed to have for them.</p>

<p>“Billings is scheming the best he knows how,” went
on Matt, “to get himself into trouble, Joe, and he’s
figuring to drag you into it.”</p>

<p>“But you’re figuring the other way,” answered McGlory,
“and I’ll back your headwork against the colonel’s
any old time. What are you planning to do now?”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to know, first, what the situation is at the
clubhouse as regards yourself. How is that you happen
to be at large?”</p>

<p>“Well, pard, the colonel couldn’t do anything with me,
so he let me go. You’ve got the report, you know.”</p>

<p>The cowboy was weaving a tangled web. The farther
he went in his deceptions the more he was obliged
to misstate the facts.</p>

<p>“You can go and come around the clubhouse,” continued
Matt, “without being in any danger from the
colonel and Levitt?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way of it.”</p>

<p>“Then our next move is to get back to Manhattan.
And, of course, we’ll have to use the runabout.”</p>

<p>“Why, Matt, we may run off the other end of Long
Island if we try to use that chug cart!”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to use it, just the same, and you’re the
one to get it from the garage. The quicker we start
on the return trip the better.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to be at that meeting to-night?”</p>

<p>“We’re both going to be there. You’re to offer the
private report in evidence, and tell all about our adventures
this morning. I guess that will spike the colonel’s
gun and block his little game of wholesale robbery.”</p>

<p>“Then my fortune will go glimmering,” said Joe, but
not with much concern.</p>

<p>“Better to let a questionable fortune go glimmering,
pard,” answered Matt earnestly, “than to do a dishonest
thing that would bother you all your life. And perhaps,”
he added solemnly, “it might get you into jail.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” shivered the cowboy, feigning trepidation.
“That’s an elegant prospect&mdash;I don’t think.”</p>

<p>“What’s more,” went on Matt, driving his suspicions
home, “the colonel’s such a schemer that I doubt
whether, if he should swindle the syndicate out of a lot
of money, he ever turned over a penny of it to you or
to any of the other original stockholders.”</p>

<p>This caused the cowboy an inward tremor. But he
allowed the fear to pass. Colonel Billings was his father’s
friend&mdash;he had said so himself; and the colonel
felt a responsibility for his welfare&mdash;which is also what
the colonel had said himself. In the light of the colonel’s
persuasions the cowboy was taking his word in
everything.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the cowboy, “the colonel is up
against the real thing now. He’s due for such a slam as
he never had before. We’re the boys to do it; eh,
Matt?”</p>

<p>“We’ll make a stand for the right,” said Matt, “and
work shoulder to shoulder to win out. The colonel talks
about a fortune. You and I can make plenty of money,
Joe. I think we have proved that. The motors are
mighty good friends to tie to, whether they’re hitched
to submarines, automobiles, or aëroplanes. We’ll pin
our faith to the explosive engine, and one of these days
it will land us honestly in Easy Street.”</p>

<p>The colonel, McGlory remembered, had mentioned
“Easy Street.” But not as Matt had done it. The
longer the cowboy talked with his chum the more he
hated himself for the part he was playing. If he talked
with Matt too long McGlory was sure his purpose
would slip from him, and that he would let out everything
about the inner history of the colonel’s manipulations
of the “Pauper’s Dream.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to look inside that manila envelope once
more, pard,” said McGlory. “There’s a part of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
private report I didn’t sabe, and I’d like to read it over
again.”</p>

<p>Matt King promptly drew the envelope from his
pocket and passed it to his chum.</p>

<p>“It’s evidence of the rascality of two men, Joe,” remarked
Matt, “and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>McGlory sprang up quickly and stepped out into the
road. He paused there, flashing his eyes up and down.
Apparently he was looking for somebody or something,
but really he was fighting with himself. He had reached
the point where he must play up his scheme for all it
was worth, or else turn his back on Billings and a fortune.</p>

<p>The cowboy felt sure he was about to do the right
thing, but to put himself in a wrong light with his beloved
pard for only a few days was proving a harder
task than he had reckoned on. Abruptly he clinched his
resolve. Slipping the manila envelope into his pocket,
he turned to look at the apprehensive face of Matt
among the bushes.</p>

<p>“What is it, Joe?” queried Matt. “Some one coming?”</p>

<p>“Some one going,” replied the cowboy, “and it’s me.
You don’t understand this, pard. Don’t think too hard
of me until you know everything.”</p>

<p>Thereupon McGlory whirled and took to his heels,
racing in the direction of the clubhouse.</p>

<p>Matt was so amazed he could not move or speak.
What ailed McGlory? What did he mean?</p>

<p>“Joe!” he shouted, starting up from the bushes.</p>

<p>But the cowboy was already around the turn in the
road and lost to Matt’s astounded eyes.</p>

<p>While Matt King stood there, his mind nearly a blank,
staring down the road and wondering, a sharp voice came
from behind him.</p>

<p>“Quick on it, Kelly! Now’s your chance!”</p>

<p>It was Levitt’s voice. Matt turned, only to be confronted
by the burly individual from the club garage.
In a flash the man grabbed him and hurled him crashing
to his back among the bushes.</p>

<p>“Steady, my lad!” threatened Kelly. “I don’t want
ter be any rougher with ye than I have ter, but orders
is orders&mdash;an’ they say you’re a thief.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_IN_THE_GARAGE" id="CHAPTER_X_IN_THE_GARAGE">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="titlefont ">IN THE GARAGE.</span></a></h2>


<p>Matt was so bewildered on account of McGlory’s actions
that he offered little resistance to Kelly and Levitt.
Anyhow, the manila envelope had been taken from him,
and Levitt&mdash;as Matt reasoned&mdash;had nothing to gain by
the capture.</p>

<p>“Here’s the rope, Kelly,” said the mining engineer,
coming close. “Better put it on him.”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to tie me,” protested Matt. “I’m not
a thief, Levitt, and you know it. I’m willing to go,
and go quietly, wherever you want to take me. I guess
I can explain the affair to the authorities so that I’ll
soon have my liberty.”</p>

<p>Levitt gave him an odd look.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” he answered. “Tie his hands,
anyway, Kelly,” he added.</p>

<p>Matt lay quietly while the rope was placed around
his wrists. He was wondering why Levitt didn’t search
him for the report. To all appearances the engineer
wasn’t giving a thought to the document.</p>

<p>“I haven’t that manila envelope, Levitt,” said Matt.
“If you’ve made a prisoner of me just to recover that
you’re having your trouble for nothing.”</p>

<p>“I knew you didn’t have the envelope,” was the surprising
answer. “McGlory got that. Kelly and I were
close enough to hear him talking with you and to see
him when he ran down the road. He fooled you that
time, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>There was growing bitterness in Matt’s heart as he
listened.</p>

<p>“You knew McGlory was to take the private report
from me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, Billings told me the cowboy had put up a deal
of some kind.”</p>

<p>“So McGlory had planned the scheme with Billings,
had he?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And McGlory took the report to Billings?”</p>

<p>“That’s where he went with it.”</p>

<p>The breath hung in Matt’s throat. His chum’s treachery
had been deliberately planned and executed. McGlory
was playing into the colonel’s hands, and bringing
about his own undoing. Naturally Matt inferred that
his friend thought more of his prospective fortune than
of his comradeship. Choosing the dishonest wealth, he
had turned his back on his friend.</p>

<p>Sad and disheartened, Matt allowed Kelly to pilot
him through the woods. With head down, the young
motorist stumbled onward, more concerned with his sorrowful
reflections than he was over the place to which
he was being taken.</p>

<p>Suddenly Matt’s forward movement was stayed, and
he heard Levitt speaking:</p>

<p>“I’ll look out for him, Kelly, and you go ahead and
make sure that there’s no one around.”</p>

<p>Matt lifted his eyes. They were at the edge of the
woods, immediately behind the garage.</p>

<p>While Levitt took charge of him, the prisoner saw
Kelly cross the open space separating the timber line
from the garage, and enter the building by a rear door.
He came back presently, leaving the door ajar.</p>

<p>“Not a soul there, Levitt,” said he. “Come on with
him, and come quick.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt was hurried over the intervening space and into
the garage. There were only two cars in the garage&mdash;the
runabout and a large touring car&mdash;and not another
person in sight.</p>

<p>Matt, pushed to the foot of a stairway leading to the
second floor, was told to climb upward. He obeyed.
At the top of the flight there was a door. Kelly pushed
it open, drew Matt inside, and Levitt came after them.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you understand just what you’re to do,
Kelly?” inquired Levitt, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>“Sure I do,” answered Kelly. “There wasn’t so much
of it that I can’t remember it all.”</p>

<p>“Do your work faithfully and you’ll never regret it.”</p>

<p>Levitt drew back out of the room and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>“Lay down on that bunk there, my lad,” said Kelly,
pointing to a cot at one side of the small room.</p>

<p>It was a room set apart for the man in charge of the
garage, and was rudely but comfortably furnished.</p>

<p>Matt, still cast down by his cowboy chum’s treachery,
was as yet taking but little interest in what happened to
him. He stumbled over upon the cot, glad of an opportunity
to rest with some degree of comfort while his
mind regained its normal powers and allowed him to
think clearly of McGlory’s case.</p>

<p>Kelly secured his feet with an end of the rope that
bound his hands.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be as considerate of ye, King,” observed
Kelly, “as I can. No harm is intended to ye&mdash;if there
was I wouldn’t be helpin’. But ye’ve got to stay here
for a while, an’ orders is that ye’re to remain quiet. The
garage is more or less of a public place, an’ yer confinement
is to be private. If people happened to be below
ye might yell. That wouldn’t do, now, would it? I’m
going to tie this piece of cloth over yer mouth jest to
make sure ye don’t say anythin’ so loud it can be heard
downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Kelly,” said Matt. “Do you know
anything about my chum, Joe McGlory?”</p>

<p>“Never a thing. He’s the boy who came with ye in
that runabout?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s not known to me at all. You’re the lad
that gave us that chase, and Levitt says you’re a thief.
Ye don’t look it, now, but orders is to hold ye, an’ that’s
what I’m doin’.”</p>

<p>“You’re helping Colonel Billings and Levitt carry
out a big swindling game by this work, Kelly.”</p>

<p>“So? Well, lad, I can’t look out for other people.
Number One&mdash;which is Kelly, d’ye mind&mdash;is enough fer
me to take care of.”</p>

<p>“If I’m a thief, why doesn’t Levitt take me to Hempstead
and have me locked up by the police?”</p>

<p>“Levitt doesn’t want to disgrace ye by such a move.
Bein’ locked up by the police gives a lad a bad record.
Ye’re far an’ away better off with me here. We’re to
be together three days, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Three days!”</p>

<p>“The same&mdash;no more, no less. We’re going to get
along like old cronies, if ye only behave. Now for the
gag.”</p>

<p>Matt submitted while the cloth was put in place.
Barely had Kelly finished when a car was heard puffing
into the big room below.</p>

<p>Kelly jumped to a round opening in the floor, near
one end of the room. It was a stovepipe hole, but the
pipe was missing.</p>

<p>“One of the members, my lad,” said Kelly, turning
away from his observation of the room underneath and
speaking in a guarded voice. “I’ll have to go and look
after the car. But ye won’t get lonesome against the
time I come back. Ye’ve plenty to think of, I take it,
an’ that will use up yer time.”</p>

<p>Kelly went out, slamming the door, and Matt could
hear him hurrying down the stairs.</p>

<p>Three days! Matt was to be kept in the garage for
three days!</p>

<p>That, no doubt, was to prevent him from interfering
with the colonel’s plans in New York.</p>

<p>The colonel had won McGlory over, and there would
be no interference from him. But perhaps, even without
that “private report,” Matt could do something with
the syndicate. It might be that he could save the cowboy
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>Matt had noticed, while he and the cowboy were in
the clubhouse talking with the colonel, that the trickster
from Arizona had a powerful influence over McGlory.
The colonel had made good use of that influence, and
had succeeded in turning the cowboy against his best
friend.</p>

<p>The people who had brought the car into the garage
had left. A mumble of talk had floated up through the
stovepipe hole, and the prisoner was able to keep the
general run of events that took place in the garage.</p>

<p>He could hear Kelly tinkering with the car that had
just arrived. In the midst of the sounds he heard footfalls,
and then a voice, lifted high:</p>

<p>“Hello! Where’s the man that runs this place?”</p>

<p>That was the colonel. Angry blood leaped in Matt’s
veins as he listened.</p>

<p>“Here, sir,” responded Kelly.</p>

<p>“Is that big touring car of Griggs’ in shape for the
road?”</p>

<p>“Fit as a fiddle, sir, an’ full up with oil and gasoline.”</p>

<p>Then followed cranking, and the sputter of an engine
picking up its cycle; and, after that, the moving off of
the car.</p>

<p>“The colonel’s away to New York,” thought Matt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
darkly. “He’s gone to get the two bars of bullion before
the bank closes. That’s step number one in the
big robbery. I wonder if Levitt and McGlory are with
him?”</p>

<p>For an hour or two longer Kelly was alone and busy
in the garage. A tin clock hung on one wall of the
bedroom, and from where Matt lay he was able to watch
the moving hands.</p>

<p>“If I accomplish anything,” Matt thought, “I shall
have to reach New York by eight o’clock. How am I
to get out of here and to the nearest railroad station?”</p>

<p>That was his problem, and it looked as though he
would have to work it out unaided.</p>

<p>He tried to free himself of the ropes, but Kelly had
tied them too securely. In order to work at them to
better advantage, he swung his bound feet over the
side of the cot and sat up. But the ropes defied every
effort he made to release his hands.</p>

<p>With the idea of watching what took place in the
garage, he slipped to his knees on the floor and then
straightened out at full length. By rolling carefully, he
succeeded in reaching the stovepipe hole.</p>

<p>His view was limited, but it commanded the broad
doors leading into the big room. Kelly was working
somewhere in the rear, and could not be seen.</p>

<p>Matt was about to roll away, when two figures appeared
in the door. One was McGlory and the other
was Levitt.</p>

<p>“Kelly!” shouted Levitt.</p>

<p>“Here!” answered Kelly, coming forward.</p>

<p>“Got a car we can use for a trip back to the city?”</p>

<p>“Only the runabout this young fellow came in.”</p>

<p>“I’m a Piute,” growled McGlory, “if I want to fool
with destruction by ridin’ in that.”</p>

<p>“I feel the same way, McGlory,” said Levitt, “but
we’ve got to get to New York. If there’s no other car
we’ll have to chance that one.”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ trouble!” groaned McGlory. “It takes
Pard Matt to get any kind of service out of that old
flugee. You can’t handle it, Levitt. I saw the kind of
work you made of it. Can’t we get a rig to take us to
the railroad station?”</p>

<p>“There are no rigs here,” answered Levitt. “It’s
either the runabout&mdash;or travel afoot.”</p>

<p>“I’m a cowpuncher, and a cowpuncher ain’t built right
for footwork. Well, let’s chance old Death and Destruction.
We’ve got to be at that meeting, and we’ve
five hours to get there. If the runabout don’t go backward
more than it does ahead, I reckon we can make it.”</p>

<p>Levitt seemed as dubious over the attempt to ride in
the runabout as was McGlory.</p>

<p>“Sure,” remarked Kelly, “she looks like a nice, easy-ridin’
little car. I’ve cleaned her, and oiled her, and
pumped her full of fuel, and she ought to travel.”</p>

<p>“She ought to, that’s a fact,” said Levitt, “but I’m
afraid she won’t. However, we’ve got to take a chance.
Hop in, McGlory.”</p>

<p>Levitt speeded up the engine and threw in the clutch.
The runabout moved quietly out of the garage.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">UNCLE TOM AGAIN.</span></a></h2>


<p>Why hadn’t McGlory and Levitt gone to the city with
Colonel Billings?</p>

<p>This is the mental question Matt put to himself, and
he was at a loss for a logical answer.</p>

<p>If McGlory and Levitt were hand and glove with the
colonel in working out his nefarious scheme, then there
was no reason in the world why they should not be traveling
together&mdash;unless the big touring car used by the
colonel had been loaded to its capacity. This did not
seem possible.</p>

<p>Nor could it be that Levitt and McGlory were taking
the runabout to get it out of Matt’s way. They didn’t
want to use the car, and they had asked Kelly for another.</p>

<p>Matt, with his curiosity still unsatisfied, was on the
point of rolling back to his cot, when some one else appeared
in the doorway. Hope leaped within him when
he recognized Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom! Matt had forgotten all about the old
negro.</p>

<p>“Marse Kelly, sah,” piped Uncle Tom, “where is yo’?”</p>

<p>“Here,” answered Kelly, coming forward. “What do
you want?”</p>

<p>“Marse Partington, whut jess come in on his car,
wants tuh speak wif yo’ er minit, Marse Kelly. He done
sont me tuh fotch yuh.”</p>

<p>“What does he want?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say, suh. He jess say, ‘Tom, yo’ lazy niggah,
run tuh de garage an’ tell Kelly Ah wants tuh see
him right off.’ Dat’s whut he say, an’ ev’rybody knows
Ah’s de hardest wo’kin’ man about de place. Lazy! Ah
ain’t so spry as I uster be, but, by golly, Ah’s&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Where is Mr. Partington, Tom?” interrupted Kelly.</p>

<p>“Jess sta’tin’ fo’ de golf links, suh.”</p>

<p>Kelly started, and Uncle Tom started with him.
Matt’s heart sank. If he could only have attracted the
old negro’s attention there would have been some one
to help him in making an escape.</p>

<p>While Matt lay on the floor, again furiously working
at the ropes, Uncle Tom slipped stealthily back into the
garage. His old rheumatic legs carried him with unusual
rapidity out of sight toward the rear of the room,
and Matt could hear him, a moment later, clambering
up the stairs.</p>

<p>Brave old Uncle Tom! He knew of Matt’s plight,
and was coming to help him.</p>

<p>The door of the bedroom was unlocked, and the darky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
came hurriedly into the room. He was shaking with
excitement, and lost not a moment hurrying to Matt’s
side.</p>

<p>“Marse Kelly would kill me daid ef he knew whut
Ah was doin’,” muttered the old negro. “We’s got tuh
hurry, Marse Matt. Marse Partington didn’t want
Marse Kelly, en dar’s gwine ter be ructions when Kelly
gits back.”</p>

<p>With trembling fingers he plucked away the gag.</p>

<p>“Don’t be scared, Uncle Tom,” said Matt reassuringly.
“Just get my hands loose and I’ll take care of
Kelly if he tries to interfere with us. I’ll look after
you.”</p>

<p>“Ah’s done lost mah job, Motah Matt,” quavered
Uncle Tom, as he worked at the rope around Matt’s
wrists. “Ah’s done got tuh git away f’om dis club
place er dat ’ar Kelly will prove de def ob me.”</p>

<p>“You can go away with me,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“But dey all owes me fo’ dollahs fo’ wo’k!”</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you five times that, Uncle Tom, for what
you’re doing.”</p>

<p>“Golly!” and the old negro’s courage seemed to return;
“five times fo’ is fifty. Whatum Ah gwine tuh
do wif fifty dollahs? Ah won’t hab tuh wo’k no mo’
fo’ six mont’s.”</p>

<p>Uncle Tom’s multiplication was of a weird variety,
but Matt did not correct his mistake.</p>

<p>Finally the knots were loosened so that Matt could
slip his hands from the encompassing coils, and he was
but a minute more in freeing his feet.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Uncle Tom,” cried he, “this way&mdash;as fast
as you can come!”</p>

<p>He sprang to the door, Uncle Tom lurching after him.</p>

<p>“Doan’ yo’ git too fur away, Marse Matt,” pleaded
the negro. “Ef dat Kelly meets me alone by mahse’f,
Ah’s gwine ter be a daid niggah. Stay by me.”</p>

<p>Matt lessened his pace so that Uncle Tom could follow
him closely out of the room and down the stairs.
They started to leave by the front of the garage, but, as
ill luck would have it, Kelly, red and wrathful, leaped
through the door directly in front of Matt.</p>

<p>“Fo’ de lan’ sakes!” wailed Uncle Tom, staggering
limply back against the wall.</p>

<p>“Clear out by the rear door, Uncle Tom!” shouted
Matt, picking up a heavy wrench from the floor.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom scrambled for the rear of the garage at
a remarkable rate of speed.</p>

<p>Kelly swore.</p>

<p>“So this was that nigger’s game, was it?” he growled.
“I knew something was up when I found Partington, and
he said he hadn’t sent fer me! I’ll skin that black villain
alive!”</p>

<p>“You’ll deal with me first, Kelly,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“Oh, you!” grunted Kelly. “Git back upstairs. It
won’t take more’n a minute to wind up your clock!”</p>

<p>The garage man drew a revolver. That he happened
to have the weapon spoke volumes for the responsibility
he felt as the jailer for Motor Matt.</p>

<p>“Put up that revolver!” ordered Matt sternly.</p>

<p>“Here’s the way I put it up,” answered Kelly, lifting
the weapon and pointing it full at Matt. “Up them
stairs with ye, an’ no more ifs nor ands about it.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Kelly,” expostulated Matt, “you’re getting
yourself into mighty deep water, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Matt was talking for a purpose&mdash;and the purpose was
to give him an opportunity to use the wrench. Suddenly
he found his chance, and the heavy instrument
shot forward and struck Kelly on the wrist of his
lifted arm. A cry of pain escaped the man, and he
reeled back, dropping the revolver.</p>

<p>Matt tried to spring past him, but Kelly, writhing with
pain though he was, pulled himself together and struck
out viciously with his left fist. Matt dodged quickly
and evaded the blow. The next instant he had used his
right fist with terrific force, hurling Kelly out of his
way and depositing him on the floor in a heap.</p>

<p>How long Kelly sat on the floor, piecing together his
scattered train of thought, he did not know; but when
his faculties returned to him, Matt was gone.</p>

<p>Kelly, muttering to himself and with both hands groping
about his bruised forehead, staggered to the door and
looked away in the direction of the road.</p>

<p>There was no one to be seen. Greatly shaken, Kelly
stumbled back to a chair near a workbench and deposited
himself in it.</p>

<p>“Felt like a batterin’-ram,” mumbled Kelly. “If I had
been kicked by a mule it wouldn’t have knocked me out
more’n what it did. Who’d have thought that lad had
so much ginger in him? Whisht, now, while I think
what’s to be done.”</p>

<p>Matt King’s escape, Kelly knew, ought to be communicated
to Levitt, in some way, but how was it to be
done? Levitt was between the clubhouse and New
York in an automobile.</p>

<p>Ah, Kelly had it! He would call up Krug’s and
tell some one there to lay for Levitt and bring him to
the telephone.</p>

<p>Kelly, alert and eager to undo some of the damage
that had been caused the plans of Levitt by Matt’s escape,
hurried to the phone in the rear of the garage,
and was soon connected with Krug’s.</p>

<p>“Any one there who knows Hannibal J. Levitt?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I’ll find out,” answered a voice from the other end
of the wire.</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up!” implored Kelly. “I’m in a tearing
rush.”</p>

<p>In about a minute&mdash;an hour it seemed to the impatient
Kelly&mdash;another voice floated back along the wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“I know Mr. Levitt,” said the voice. “He was here
this morning, but he’s not here now.”</p>

<p>“Sure he’s not there?” responded Kelly. “This is the
garage at the Malvern Country Club&mdash;get that? Levitt
left here in a runabout an hour ago, bound for New
York. He ought to pass your place in a little while.
Lay for him. If you can, get him to the phone and
have him call up Kelly&mdash;Kelly at the Malvern Country
Club garage, understand&mdash;it will be worth a fiver to
Levitt. Have somebody watch for the runabout an’
flag Levitt. Will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Kelly, highly pleased with himself, hung up the receiver.
Then he waited&mdash;waited an hour, two hours,
three hours&mdash;waited until nightfall, till 7 o’clock, 8
o’clock, 9 o’clock came, but no call arrived from Krug’s.</p>

<p>The reason was that Levitt did not pass Krug’s Corner.
It was the only route from the Malvern Country
Club to New York&mdash;but, nevertheless, Levitt did not
pass.</p>

<p>The white runabout passed, however, and it had two
passengers.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">A STARTLING MYSTERY.</span></a></h2>


<p>Matt, on leaving the garage, gave a hasty look around
for Uncle Tom. The old negro was not in sight. Matt
could not spend any time looking for him, in that particular
place, and ran for the road, hoping to find Uncle
Tom waiting for him farther on.</p>

<p>In this he was not disappointed. Well toward the place
where Matt had had his memorable interview with his
cowboy pard, the negro pushed out of the undergrowth.</p>

<p>“Marse Matt,” he chattered, “Ah’s been er-waitin’.
Ah ’low’ed ye’d come dishyer way. Whut done happen
tuh dat Kelly?”</p>

<p>“I got away from him,” Matt answered.</p>

<p>“By golly, Ah got away, too. Nevah run so fas’ en
mah life. Five times fo’ is fifty. Yo’ all ain’t er-fo’gittin’
dat, is yuh?”</p>

<p>“No, Uncle Tom; I’m not forgetting anything.”</p>

<p>Matt had nearly a hundred dollars in his pocket, and
if he had not thought he was going to need considerable
extra money for his trip back to the city he’d been given
the negro nearly the whole of it.</p>

<p>“There’s your fifty, Uncle Tom,” said Matt. “You
go to Hempstead and stay with Topsy until you can
find another job.”</p>

<p>“Ah doan’ want no job twell Ah git out ob money,
marse, en den Ah’s hopin’ ye’ll be ready tuh take me
on as yo’ private mascot. Ah tells yuh, marse, yo’s
monsus short on luck, seems lak. Yo’s had a powahful
bad streak to-day. Where’d yo’ hab been ef it hadn’t
been fo’ Ole Tom? Golly, Ah’s afeared tuh guess!”</p>

<p>“How did you know I was up there over the garage?”</p>

<p>“Ah seed yo’ when yo’ was brought intuh de garage,
marse. Marse Whitmore, at de clubhouse, done sent me
tuh ask Kelly somethin’, en Kelly wasn’t erroun’ de
place. Ah waited; den Ah seed yo’ come in froo de

’bout Marse Whitmore. Went tuh hunt him up, but he

en Ah wo’ked hit out, yassuh. En she wo’ked, didn’t
she? Yo’ knows ’bout dat. Say, marse, is five times
fo’ fifty er skiventy? ’Pears lak Ah ain’t jess right en
mah ’rithmetic.”</p>

<p>“It’s nearer fifty than seventy, Uncle Tom. If I
could spare any more money, though, I’d give it to you.”</p>

<p>“Yo’s allers gen’rous lak dat, en dat’s de reason Ah
likes tuh mascot fo’ yo’. When does yo’ all think yo’ll
need me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell that for a while, Uncle Tom. You go to
Hempstead and stay with Topsy. That’s the place
for you. You’re getting altogether too old to work.”</p>

<p>“Huccome yo’ lef’ Denvah? Whar yo’ all been, huh?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been in a good many places, Uncle Tom, since I
left Denver. I’m certainly going to do something for
you, Uncle Tom,” answered Matt; “but I can’t say just
when.”</p>

<p>“Ah’s got fifty-five dollahs, marse, en hit’ll las’ me er
long while, yassuh, but doan’ yo’ git de notion hit’ll las’
too long. When hit plays out Ah wants tuh wo’k fo’
yo’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to hurry, Uncle Tom,” said Matt. “You
can stroll along to Hempstead and take your time; but
I’ve got important business in New York.”</p>

<p>“Yo’s allers doin’ somethin’. Nevah seed sich a fellah
fo’ bein’ evahlastin’ly on de go. Ah’m gwine tuh root
fo’ yo’, marse. ’Deed Ah is. When good luck come yo’

Ah can do a heap bettah at dat ef Ah’m ’long clos’ tuh
yo’. Dishyer long-range mascottin’ done li’ble tuh wind
up on er snag. ’Membah dat, too.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember everything, Uncle Tom,” said Matt.
“You stay in Hempstead with Topsy. Good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Marse Matt.”</p>

<p>Matt shook the darky’s hand warmly, turned and hurried
on along the road.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom was a grafter, but nevertheless Matt had
a warm place in his heart for the old fellow. His peculiarities
were all on the humorous side, and Matt could
have enjoyed his talk if circumstances had been different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>While Matt was striding onward, his thoughts keeping
pace with his swift gait, he heard suddenly the hum
of a motor in the distance.</p>

<p>All motors have the same sort of music. The tempo
changes with work at the throttle, but a trained ear can
follow the shifting gears; and, now and then, there’s
a man who will recognize his car by the croon of the
engine alone.</p>

<p>It seemed to Matt that there was something familiar
in the sound he heard.</p>

<p>The road, for a long distance at that particular point,
lay in a straight stretch.</p>

<p>The car was coming toward Matt, but the trees on
either side of the road made the approaching machine
indistinct. Their boughs dropped low, and the deep
shadows of the westering sun lay heavily across the
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Suddenly Matt caught a glimpse of white flashing in
the gloom.</p>

<p>The runabout! ran his startled thought.</p>

<p>Yes, undoubtedly it was the strange hoodoo car that
was approaching.</p>

<p>What did it mean?</p>

<p>Were Levitt and McGlory returning to the Country
Club? Had they found the car more than they could
manage, and were they taking it back to the garage?</p>

<p>This did not seem a satisfactory explanation, and yet
Matt could think of nothing else.</p>

<p>At a halt in the middle of the road Matt waited for
the car to draw near. If McGlory was in the machine,
that was as good a time as any for a meeting and an explanation.</p>

<p>But the cowboy was not in the car, nor was Levitt,
so far as Matt could see, or anybody else.</p>

<p>The car was on the reverse, and backing down the
road, most marvelously keeping a straight line, although
now and then lurching sideways a little and narrowly
escaping the trunk of a tree at the roadside.</p>

<p>Here was a startling mystery!</p>

<p>What had happened to McGlory and Levitt?</p>

<p>While Matt wondered, he was making preparations
to board the car and do his best to get it under control.</p>

<p>It was coming at a slow rate of speed, and to leap
aboard would not be difficult.</p>

<p>When within a dozen feet of the young motorist, the
car seemed to recognize an enemy and to attempt to
turn aside.</p>

<p>Matt ran forward, stopped, executed a flying leap and
gained the running board. Another moment and he
was in the driver’s seat and had brought the car to a
halt.</p>

<p>The reverse gear was engaged, so the runabout had
ample warrant for crawfishing along the road.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the car, however, that offered
any clue to the mystery of what had become of the
two who had taken the runabout from the Country Club
garage.</p>

<p>Matt got down and made a hurried examination. The
car was in as good condition as ever, and rebuffed his
efforts at getting clues.</p>

<p>There was something uncanny about the machine.
Matt admitted it to himself. It acted in a way that defied
all explanation, at times, and that alone was enough
to get on a chauffeur’s nerves.</p>

<p>Perhaps Billy was right, and that the “double hoodoo,”
in some incomprehensible manner, was accountable for
the car’s tantrums.</p>

<p>So far as McGlory and Levitt were concerned, there
was a possibility that the car had misbehaved so outrageously
that they had put on the reverse and cast it
adrift, to go where it would.</p>

<p>But there were other travelers in the road to think of.
Levitt and McGlory would scarcely take chances of
wrecking some other machine, or of running down a carriage,
or some pedestrian.</p>

<p>Matt was deeply puzzled.</p>

<p>“Well,” he thought, “I want a way to return to New
York, and here it is. It meets me on the road, and I
should be foolish not to take advantage of it. Quite
likely Joe and Levitt have found other and more satisfactory
means for reaching the city. I don’t blame them
for changing to another car, if they had the opportunity,
or for taking a railroad train if they happened to be
conveniently near one. There’s no railroad very close
to this place, though, and the runabout couldn’t have
come far, with no one in control.”</p>

<p>There was enough gas in the cylinders so that the
motor took the spark. The runabout leaped ahead, perfectly
obedient to Matt’s hand.</p>

<p>As he swept along he looked and listened for some
signs of McGlory and Levitt. He came upon the two
missing passengers suddenly&mdash;and what he saw caused
him to jam down hard on the brakes and leap from the
car before it was fairly at a stop.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES.</span></a></h2>


<p>Joe McGlory was kneeling beside the road, tying a
handkerchief bandage around the forehead of Levitt.
The latter was sprawled out limply on the ground, his
clothing torn and disarranged.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Joe?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>The cowboy’s face was pale, and the set lines of it
indicated that he was himself in pain.</p>

<p>“That’s you, is it, pard?” he asked huskily.</p>

<p>For a useless question McGlory threw a good deal of
feeling into it.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I might have known you’d come pounding along if I
was in trouble. Levitt is badly hurt. He’s been unconscious
ever since he dropped in the road. I can’t
bring him back to his senses&mdash;but I haven’t been able to
do much, being about half knocked out.”</p>

<p>Matt went down on his knees, laid a hand over Levitt’s
heart, and then felt of his pulse.</p>

<p>“He’ll do, I think, Joe. Is he hurt anywhere else except
in the head?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. He was thrown headfirst against
the tree there.”</p>

<p>Matt lifted the bandage and surveyed the wound.
The light was none too good, and he asked his chum
to strike a match.</p>

<p>“It may be a fracture of the skull,” said Matt, replacing
the bandage. “We’ve got to get him into the
hands of a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Hempstead’s the nearest place, I reckon. It can’t
be more than a mile from here.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go there.”</p>

<p>Riding on two seats, with an unconscious and wounded
man to look after, was not going to be child’s play for
Matt and McGlory&mdash;particularly as the cowboy was not
in very good condition himself. Then, too, cramped as
he was going to be, Matt would have to look after the
runabout. That might be an easy matter, and it might
not. It all depended on how the runabout was going to
act.</p>

<p>“Can you help me get him into the car, Joe?” asked
Matt.</p>

<p>“I’m not good for much, Matt,” was the response;
“but I’ll do what I can.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Just shaken up, I reckon. I’ve had a good many
falls, but never one like that before.”</p>

<p>Matt, when Levitt was lifted, contrived to carry most
of the burden. McGlory groaned when the limp form
of Levitt was in the car, and grabbed at the car seat to
support himself.</p>

<p>“Something has happened to you, old chap, besides
a mere shaking up,” averred Matt. “I guess I’ll have
to leave you at Hempstead with Levitt.”</p>

<p>“Nary, you don’t. I’ve got to get to that meeting.”</p>

<p>Matt made no answer to this. It brought up a subject
which he was not yet ready to discuss.</p>

<p>“Get into the car, Joe,” said he. “Hold Levitt’s head
up between your knees, if you can. I won’t be able to
help support him&mdash;the car will take all my attention.”</p>

<p>“If this infernal contraption goes off the jump again,”
scowled McGlory, “it’s liable to do for all of us.”</p>

<p>In a few moments they were loaded. The cowboy,
braced in the seat, supported the upper half of Levitt’s
body between his knees. This left Matt elbow room for
running the car.</p>

<p>The runabout started off cleverly enough, and Matt
believed it would act well for the short trip to Hempstead.</p>

<p>“How did the accident happen, Joe?” he asked, when
they were well away.</p>

<p>“I wish somebody would tell me,” answered McGlory.
“We were going along at not more than twenty-five
miles an hour when, without any warning, it buck-jumped,
and stopped dead. Levitt was thrown out
sideways against the tree. I missed the trees, but took
the roadside on my head and shoulders, as near as I can
recollect. I was dazed for a couple of minutes, and
when I rounded up my wits I saw Levitt unconscious, a
dozen feet from where I was lying. That’s all. I was
trying to tinker him up when you came along. Where
did you pick up the car?”</p>

<p>“A little way back on the road. It was on the reverse,
and moving slowly.”</p>

<p>“How did it get on the reverse?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. Sufferin’ brain twisters! The same thing
happened on the Jericho Pike this morning, you remember.”</p>

<p>Matt was silent. Before either he or the cowboy
could speak Levitt began to talk.</p>

<p>“Play the game, Billings! If you’re going to hocus
the syndicate, you’ve got to pay me money enough to
make it worth while. A quarter of the proceeds, Billings,
or I give Random &amp; Griggs my private report.
That will cook your goose.”</p>

<p>McGlory gasped.</p>

<p>“He’s delirious,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he thinks he’s talking with Billings,” said McGlory.
“Speak to me about that!”</p>

<p>“It’s just as I told you, Joe,” went on Matt quietly.
“Your colonel is out to make a big winning, and to
make it dishonestly. If he&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Levitt began again.</p>

<p>“You didn’t know I had that private report, did you?”
A weird laugh came with the words. “I’m a bit foxy
myself, colonel. The ‘Pauper’s Dream’ isn’t worth what
it cost to put down the shaft. You haven’t any vein.
There was a pocket, but the pocket has been worked out.
You’ve got to come across with a pile if you make me
suppress that private report.”</p>

<p>“I’m the biggest blockhead that walks the face o’ the
earth!” declared McGlory. “I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Levitt interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Keep your eye on Matt King, Billings! If lightning
hits us, that cub will be back of it!”</p>

<p>There was something grewsome about that limp form
with its bandaged head, swaying between McGlory’s
unsteady knees and mumbling villainous revelations.</p>

<p>For a while Levitt was silent, and the runabout glided
through the outskirts of Hempstead and Matt inquired
the way to the nearest doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The car continued to remain on its good behavior,
and carried its passengers steadily and safely to the
walk in front of the doctor’s office. Some bystanders
helped carry Levitt in, and he was laid on a couch, very
white and weak and continuing to mumble his delirious
disclosures.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble with him?” inquired the doctor.</p>

<p>“Automobile accident,” answered Matt briefly.</p>

<p>“They’re always happening,” commented the medical
man grimly. “Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Hannibal J. Levitt. We’ll have to leave him in your
care, doctor. My friend and I have got to hurry on to
New York to attend a meeting at eight o’clock to-night.”</p>

<p>The doctor, busily examining Levitt, turned up a suspicious
face.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to tell me a little bit more about this
man before you go,” said he. “He may have been hurt
in an automobile accident, or he may have been hit on
the head with a sand bag.”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ hold-ups!” muttered McGlory. “Do you
take us for strong-arm men?”</p>

<p>Just at that moment a policeman entered.</p>

<p>“Heard there was an injured man brought in here,
doc,” said he.</p>

<p>The doctor explained&mdash;not only about the injured man,
but about Matt’s hurry to get away to New York.</p>

<p>The policeman also became suspicious. Matt, however,
took him apart and went into a somewhat lengthy
explanation. He told who he was, and managed to
convince the officer of his identity. The name of Matt
King was not unknown to the bluecoat, and he was prepared
to take all that Matt said in good faith.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Doc,” said the officer, as soon as Matt
had finished talking; “these young fellows didn’t have
anything more to do with that man’s condition than you
or I. We’ll look after Levitt. Badly hurt?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Seriously?”</p>

<p>“Not dangerously, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Then we’re free to go, are we, officer?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“Sure. Skip whenever you’re ready. If I want you
or your friend I’ll phone your New York hotel.”</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory, followed by the troubled eyes of
the doctor, went out to the runabout. Before starting,
Matt got the lamps to going.</p>

<p>“Now for Manhattan,” said he, climbing to his seat.</p>

<p>“Or the ditch,” added McGlory. “The way I feel now
I don’t care much what happens to us.”</p>

<p>“That’s a funny way for you to feel, Joe,” said Matt
quietly.</p>

<p>The car moved off in fine order&mdash;an exhibition which
made Matt feel like congratulating himself.</p>

<p>“I’m entitled to my feelings, pard. For what I’ve done
to-day you ought to cut me out of your herd.”</p>

<p>“You made a mistake&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“A big one; and there was no excuse for it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there was, Joe. There must have been.”</p>

<p>McGlory mumbled to himself and fell silent.</p>

<p>“You hadn’t got far along the road from the clubhouse,”
said Matt, “when the accident happened. But
you must have been gone an hour. If your pace was
twenty-five miles an hour, how&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The car bothered us like Sam Hill,” cut in McGlory.
“If it wasn’t one thing, it was two. Neither Levitt nor
I was as good a hand at tinkering as you, and we had
to hunt quite a spell before we located the troubles.”</p>

<p>“You found something wrong?”</p>

<p>“A dozen things!”</p>

<p>“That’s strange! When this runabout gets to acting
up, it usually seems to be without any cause whatever.”</p>

<p>“Well,” finished the cowboy, “that explains how we
were going twenty-five miles an hour, at the time the
accident happened, and didn’t get any farther from the
Malvern Country Club.”</p>

<p>After this there was another silence between the
chums. McGlory was getting ready to explain, and
Matt patiently waited.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV_MGLORYS_LESSON" id="CHAPTER_XIV_MGLORYS_LESSON">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="titlefont ">M’GLORY’S LESSON.</span></a></h2>


<p>“Pard,” said McGlory finally, “I’ve connected with a
lesson this afternoon that’s made the biggest kind of an
impression on me.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a lesson, Joe?” asked Matt.</p>

<p>“The kind that hits you plumb between the eyes like
a bolt of lightning. Did you ever think you were smart,
and then wake up and find yourself the biggest fool in
seven states? No, I don’t reckon you ever did. That’s
not the way Pard Matt is built.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re wrong, Joe. I’ve been there.
We all of us take a wrong course, now and then. We
wouldn’t be human if we didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ horn toads! Why, I thought all along I was
starring myself, and that I’d laugh at you in a few days
for being the one who’d made the bobble.”</p>

<p>“The trouble with you was, Joe, Colonel Billings had
too much influence over you.”</p>

<p>“He’s got an oily tongue, Matt, and a brain that’s a
wonder. After you dropped from the window, the
colonel nailed me and pinned me down in a chair. I
was as mad as a hornet, and ready to give him a right
hook to the jaw, or any other kind of a right-hander
that would make him take the count. That’s how I felt
for about a minute&mdash;red-hot and boiling. But only for a
minute. The colonel started his tongue, and I fell on his
neck and shed tears of joy because he had singled me
out to help feather-finger the kicks of the plutocrats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Not in those words, however. The colonel made it look
like a just and warranted proceeding.</p>

<p>“The colonel allows Pard Matt is a blockhead, and
that he’s taken a few facts and used ’em as signboards
for the wrong trail. The colonel admits hiring Levitt
to make a bogus report; but the bogus report, according
to the colonel, was the one we found, and not the other
gilt-edged prospectus submitted to the syndicate.”</p>

<p>“Why did he hire Levitt to make a report saying that
the mine was no good?” inquired the amazed Matt.</p>

<p>“He didn’t, pard; he only said he did. I find there’s
some sort of a difference between what the colonel really
does and what he tells people he does. He knew the
‘Pauper’s Dream’ was rich, long before he sold me my
stock. Then some of the stockholders who knew the
same thing tried to freeze the colonel out. But the
colonel was too wise. He sank the shaft without finding
any gold&mdash;just to fool the stockholders who wanted
to get rid of him. These fellows immediately sold out
to the colonel, so that the colonel got hold of the majority
of the stock. That means, of course, that he had
the entire say about everything connected with the mine.</p>

<p>“As soon as he has the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ cinched,
Billings begins to hit the simon-pure, ne-plus-ultra gold-bearing
vein. Buyers flock to the scene. The colonel
picks out this syndicate of Random &amp; Griggs’ as the
boys to get the mine. Levitt comes out to examine the
mine for the syndicate. The stockholders who have been
frozen out begin to grow restive, and to threaten legal
complications. Then Billings shows his fine Italian hand
by hiring Levitt to make out that report, saying the
‘Dream’ is a pocket, and that the pocket is empty. That’s
for the soreheaded stockholders to see, and they see it.
So, in that way, legal complications are sidetracked
while the colonel is selling the mine to the syndicate.”</p>

<p>McGlory relapsed into silence for a mile, while the
runabout behaved beautifully and drove long shafts of
light from the search lamps into the growing dark.</p>

<p>“That,” continued the cowboy, stirring, “is the yarn
the colonel put up to me. I swallowed it. But, pard, I
wanted to tell you. The colonel said you mustn’t know
a thing until after the deal was closed and the proceeds
divided. As I figure it now, I reckon the colonel was
afraid you’d jab a little horse sense into his yarn and
puncture it. Anyhow, the truth remains that he made
me believe I’d lose a fortune by telling you the truth
about that private report. ‘Tell your friend about it
later,’ says the colonel, ‘and then have a good laugh with
him over the way he was fooled.’ So I smoothed down
my rising feathers, laid low, and planned to sneak the
private report on you all by myself.</p>

<p>“You know how I did that. You trusted me, and
asked the old darky to tell me where you were. As soon
as Uncle Tom had delivered your message, I rushed
right off to the colonel and repeated it to him. Then
I met you, executed my brilliant play, got the report, and
delivered it to my good friend the colonel. He now has
it in his pocket, or else he has burned it. Anyhow, you
can bet a million against the hole in a doughnut that he
don’t show that report to the syndicate. The question
is, pard, will those syndicate people believe you and
me?”</p>

<p>“It won’t matter much,” answered Matt, “whether
they do or don’t. By jumping in there and telling them
the truth, we’ll be placing ourselves on record.”</p>

<p>“I see. Then, if they’re skinned, we can read our
titles clear and they’ll have only themselves to blame.
But, pard, what have you been up to since I worked
through that brilliant trick and left you staring at me
from the bushes?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been a prisoner in the loft over the garage,” answered
Matt.</p>

<p>“A prisoner?” echoed McGlory. “How was that?”</p>

<p>Matt told him the details.</p>

<p>“Oh, speak to me about that!” growled the cowboy.
“Hannibal J. Levitt never mentioned the fact of your
capture to me. If I’d known what had happened to you,
pard, I’d have torn loose from the whole combination,
fortune or no fortune. Why,” sputtered McGlory, as
reflection brought the hidden details more and more before
him, “Levitt never could have made that play if I
hadn’t told Billings where I was to meet you! They
got their heads together and worked it out.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you and Levitt ride into town with the
colonel, Joe?”</p>

<p>“He thought it would be better for us to come by
ourselves. He was ’way ahead of time, you know, and
had to go to the bank before closing hours for the
bullion. It wasn’t necessary for Levitt and me to be
around until time for the meeting. Oh, I’ve had a fine
run for my auburn chip, and no mistake. I’ll resign,
here and now, from our partnership. The place for me
is the range. Cattle punching is about the scope of my
ability, and it ought to be the height of my ambition.
Consider my resignation handed in, pard.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Matt, “consider it declined. I won’t accept
it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make any misplay now, old chap,” begged McGlory.
“I’m about as dependable as this crazy runabout.
Sometimes I answer the control, but you’ve just
seen how I can take the bit in my teeth and play hob
with everything. I don’t think you can trust me, pard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know any one I can trust better, Joe,” answered
Matt.</p>

<p>“If you mean that, shake.”</p>

<p>Their hands clasped for an instant, and McGlory
stifled a groan and clutched at his side.</p>

<p>“Say,” demanded Matt, “what’s wrong with you?”</p>

<p>“All jarred to pieces. That fall did it. When you
shook my right hand I thought I was coming apart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish,” said Matt, “that I’d had the Hempstead
doctor look at you.”</p>

<p>“Look at me? Well, I reckon he did. He looked at
me as though he thought I was a sandbagger. And
he came pretty near having it right, at that.”</p>

<p>“You know what I mean, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I do. But we didn’t have time. We may be
late for the meeting as it is. The colonel has showed his
bullion, and flashed that affidavit about its coming from
the ‘Pauper’s Dream’ as the result of a week’s run, and
perhaps the syndicate has been stampeded. We may be
too late.”</p>

<p>“We’ll not be too late to go on record,” declared
Matt.</p>

<p>“Tell me this, pard,” said the cowboy: “Why were
you piking for New York at the time you met the
runabout backing down the road with no one aboard?”</p>

<p>“I had started for the meeting in Random &amp; Griggs’
office,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“You were going there just the same, eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“While I was doing everything I could to help the
colonel get me into trouble, you were still hustling to
keep me out of it?”</p>

<p>“I knew Billings had influenced you in some way,
Joe.”</p>

<p>“That’s the sort of a fellow for a pard! Of course
you’re the lad to tie to. The wonder is that you’re still
willing to hang onto me.”</p>

<p>“Random &amp; Griggs must be as badly deceived in the
colonel as any one else,” observed Matt.</p>

<p>“He can pull the wool over any one’s eyes, that fellow!”</p>

<p>“He was stopping at Griggs’ house, and the broker
had put him up at the Country Club.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! And how the colonel has used that
Country Club! The members of the club will be tickled
to death if they ever find it out. You can do something
to that tinhorn, Kelly, if you want to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. He was working for Levitt&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Just as I was working for the colonel, eh? Maybe
he was as badly fooled, too.”</p>

<p>For some time McGlory leaned back in his seat and
kept quiet. Matt was worried about him.</p>

<p>“How do you feel now, Joe?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking,” answered McGlory, “that this
hoodoo car is trying to make up for the tough times it
has given us. It’s about the worst combination of cylinders,
rubber tires, and spark plugs that was ever put together,
but, for all that, if it hadn’t cut up a few tantrums
on the Jericho Pike this morning we’d never have found
out a thing about the colonel’s crooked work.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good,
pard.”</p>

<p>“While the car’s running good, Matt, crowd the speed
limit. Let’s get to Liberty Street as soon as we can.”</p>

<p>Matt proceeded to follow out his chum’s suggestion.</p>

<span class="titlefont ">HURLING A BOMB.</span></a></h2>


<p>Half a dozen men were gathered in the private conference
room of Random &amp; Griggs’ palatial brokerage
offices in Liberty Street. One of these half dozen was
the colonel. Another was Joshua Griggs. The remaining
four were capitalists.</p>

<p>Colonel Mark Antony Billings was in his element.
He had never looked more impressive than he did then.
Levitt and McGlory had failed to arrive in time for the
meeting, but they might come later. In any event,
their presence was not of supreme importance.</p>

<p>In front of the colonel, on the mahogany table,
sparkled the two bars of yellow bullion. They caught
the gleams from the incandescent lights and reflected
luring rays into the eyes of the capitalists.</p>

<p>The capitalists seemed greatly impressed. Griggs&mdash;the
brokerage firm was to receive a very large commission
if the mine was sold&mdash;wore a broad and amiable
smile. The colonel was plausible and full of tact, answering
questions promptly.</p>

<p>In the midst of the deliberations the quiet of Liberty
Street was disturbed by the sputter of an automobile.
For the most part, Liberty Street, in the vicinity of the
brokers’ offices, was a deserted cañon at that hour.</p>

<p>But if the automobile disturbed the quiet of the street,
it did not disturb the deliberations of those in Random
&amp; Griggs’ offices. It took a rap on the outer door to
do that. Mr. Griggs himself answered the summons.</p>

<p>“McGlory and Levitt, colonel,” he called.</p>

<p>Mr. Griggs had made a slight mistake. Hearing the
name McGlory, and understanding that Levitt was expected
with him, the broker had jumped at conclusions.</p>

<p>“The expert, gentlemen,” smiled the colonel, addressing
the capitalists, “whom you sent to investigate my
little property. A very painstaking person, and reliable
to the last degree. McGlory is one of our original stockholders;
a young man&mdash;a mere lad, in fact&mdash;but sharp as
a steel trap.” The colonel lifted his voice. “Have them
come right in, Mr. Griggs,” he called.</p>

<p>Matt King and McGlory did not stand on the order.
Supporting his chum by the arm, King and the cowboy
passed into the conference room and stood under the
astounded eyes of the colonel.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Mr. Isidore Sleipnitz, one of the moneyed
men, “dot ain’t der expert, Levitt. Neider of ’em is
Levitt.”</p>

<p>“But I’m McGlory,” said the cowboy, steadying himself
by leaning against a table. Although his face was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
white, his eyes glowed with resolution and steadfast purpose.
“Mr. Levitt was thrown from the automobile and
injured. He’s now in a doctor’s office in Hempstead.
This is my chum, Matt King. If he hadn’t picked me
up I’d never have got here.”</p>

<p>The colonel, to put it colloquially, “smelled a rat.”
Something was wrong, and he knew it.</p>

<p>“This meeting, gentlemen,” said he, “is not for outsiders.
Mr. King is not a stockholder in the ‘Pauper’s
Dream,’ nor, so far as I am informed, is he one of your
syndicate. I think he had better withdraw.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to withdraw,” said Matt, “until I tell
these gentlemen of your crooked transactions in the
matter of the mine you are trying to sell them. McGlory
and I have come here for that purpose, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence!” roared the colonel, starting menacingly toward
Matt. “Do you think, for a minute, you can blow
in here and blacken my character in the eyes of these
gentlemen?” Billings struck a pose, and shoved one
hand into the breast of his long coat. “I am too well
known,” he went on, “to suffer from the maunderings of
a cub like you!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to put in a few maunderings of my own,
colonel,” said McGlory. “I’ll have to hurry, too, for I
got badly shaken up in that accident that knocked out
Levitt. There were two reports&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence!” thundered the colonel. “Get out of here,
McGlory! Clear out, I say, and take that other young
scoundrel with you. If you don’t, I’ll call the police!”</p>

<p>Hiram McCormick, another of the capitalists, got up
from his chair and raised his hand.</p>

<p>“This isn’t one of your Southwestern ‘rough-houses,’
colonel,” said he, “so please remember that. Roar less
and listen more, will you? I am interested in hearing
what these young men have to say.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the way you stack up,” clamored the colonel,
grabbing his slouch hat and his gold bullion from the
table, “I’ll make myself absent. I didn’t come here to
be insulted.”</p>

<p>He started for the door. Before he could reach it the
door of a telephone booth opened and a blue-coated
man, with a star flashing on his breast, stepped in front
of him.</p>

<p>The appearance of the policeman was a surprise to
the colonel, Griggs, Matt, and McGlory. The four capitalists
did not seem to think it anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where did that man come from?” inquired
Griggs.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as he was a member of the firm that occupied
the offices, it might be supposed that he would have
had knowledge of any policeman secreted about the
premises. But it was plain he had not been informed of
the presence of this particular officer.</p>

<p>Hiram McCormick was still on his feet. While the
colonel was glaring at the policeman, Mr. McCormick
observed calmly:</p>

<p>“Mr. Griggs, we shall have to ask your pardon for
the presence of the officer. He slipped in, by my request,
before the colonel came, and while you were in the board
room.”</p>

<p>“What’s he here for?” inquired Griggs.</p>

<p>“That will appear later. Just now he is going to
keep the colonel with us while these young men relieve
their minds.”</p>

<p>Colonel Billings understood that he was face to face
with disaster&mdash;a disaster so comprehensive that he could
not readily grasp it. Heeding a motion of the officer’s
hand, he dropped defiantly into a chair.</p>

<p>“Now, my lad,” said McCormick to the cowboy.</p>

<p>McGlory jumped at once into his recital. Beginning
away back in his New York experience, he told of the
trouble he and Matt had had on account of the bullion;
then, after showing the telegram which had been sent
to him over the signature of “Joshua Griggs,” he began
narrating the adventures which had fallen to him and
Matt on that eventful day. The colonel’s double-dealing
was shown up in all its ugly brazenness, and the
cowboy finished by regretting that he had not the private
report of Hannibal J. Levitt to offer in evidence.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” suggested Matt, “the colonel can show it
to you, if it has not already been destroyed.”</p>

<p>“The colonel,” spoke up that gentleman witheringly,
“is not here to be bossed by a fellow of your stripe.
Your wild and woolly stories seem to have made a hit
with the representatives of capital, but they’re fakes,
and everybody here will know they’re fakes, before many
days.”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” put in Mr. Griggs, whose faith in the
colonel was dying hard, “is it right to take the word of
these boys against a man so well known throughout the
Southwest as Colonel Billings?”</p>

<p>Colonel Billings waved his hand gently but firmly
toward Mr. Griggs.</p>

<p>“Never mind me, sir,” said he. “The kid element
seems to predominate in the meeting, and men of experience
and reason are relegated to the background. Don’t
disturb yourself on my account, I beg. There are other
bidders for the ‘Pauper’s Dream.’ The mine will be
snapped up before the week is over.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Griggs,” went on Hiram McCormick, “these
young men have come here&mdash;one of them with everything
to lose and nothing to gain by blocking the sale
of the mine&mdash;and told us a most remarkable story of
guile and duplicity. I may say, however, that neither I
nor my associates are surprised. We have already had
cause to suspect the colonel of double-dealing. Two
experts were sent by us to examine the ‘Pauper’s
Dream.’ In matters of this sort, it is best not to place
all your faith in one man. Levitt went to the mine, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
himself known to the colonel, and examined the prospect
under his supervision. Perhaps it is not to be wondered
at that the colonel bought him. But the second
expert reached the mine in laborer’s clothes, and was
hired by the colonel to ‘salt’ the breast of the ‘Pauper’s
Dream’ tunnel. I have that man’s report here in my
pocket. It only arrived to-day, but my friends of this
projected syndicate have all read it. For this reason we
feared we might have trouble with the colonel, and so
we smuggled the policeman into the telephone booth.</p>

<p>“Colonel Billings,” and McCormick turned and leveled
a hard look at the Arizona man, “your rascally game
would not have succeeded, even had these lads not come
here and told us of your knavery. We had you spotted.
From now on you will be blacklisted in this town, and
you will try in vain to float any other mining proposition
on New York capital. Mr. Griggs was deceived
in you, and he and his partner have our sympathy, and
have not lost a particle of our good will; but as for
you, if you are not out of the city within twenty-four
hours we shall try and see just how much responsibility
the law can put upon you for this day’s events. There
is the door; close it from the outside.”</p>

<p>The colonel got up. Calmly he drew a canvas bag
from his pocket, and deliberately placed his gold bars
within it; then, holding the bag in one hand, he allowed
the other to dart toward his hip&mdash;a move young King
had seen before.</p>

<p>“Look out for him!” warned Matt.</p>

<p>The officer grabbed a revolver out of the colonel’s
hand in just the nick of time. There was a brief struggle,
but the colonel got the worst of it.</p>

<p>“I’ll play even with that cub of a Matt King,” the
colonel was heard to breathe, “if it’s the last thing I
ever do.”</p>

<p>“Take him out, officer,” said Hiram McCormick, in
undisguised contempt, “and, of course, you’ll confiscate
the weapon. This is not Arizona.”</p>

<p>None too gently the policeman hustled Colonel Billings
out of the door. Hardly had they left when McGlory
staggered, tossed his hands, and fell heavily into
Matt’s arms.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a flurry of excitement in the office,
Griggs, McCormick, and the others all hurrying
forward to be of what assistance they could.</p>

<p>Joe McGlory drifted back to conscience amid surroundings
that were entirely new to him. He was in a
white iron bed. On one side of the bed stood a woman
in a white cap and apron, and on the other side was a
man in black. Over the foot of the bed leaned Matt,
his anxious face clearing a little as McGlory opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah!” murmured the doctor.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” inquired the cowboy.</p>

<p>“In the emergency ward of the City Hospital,” answered
the doctor.</p>

<p>“I’ve got about as much right here as a maverick
steer in a watermelon patch. Sufferin’ sister, what a
jolt!”</p>

<p>A smile sneaked over the doctor’s face. The nurse
turned her head. Matt laughed, highly delighted.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right, don’t you think so, doctor?” Matt
asked.</p>

<p>“A lad who can come out from under the influence
of a narcotic with such a flow of spirits,” averred the
doctor, “is bound to be all right.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with me?” the cowboy asked.</p>

<p>“A couple of broken ribs.”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d busted something! Say, Matt!”</p>

<p>“What is it, Joe?”</p>

<p>“The last I remember I was in the office of Random &amp;
Griggs. When was that?”</p>

<p>“Last night.”</p>

<p>The cowboy turned his head so he could see the sunlight
coming through the window.</p>

<p>“And now it’s this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“When will I get out of here, doc? This afternoon?”</p>

<p>“If you get out of here in less than two weeks you’ll
do well,” said the doctor.</p>

<p>“Speak to me about that!” muttered McGlory.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Joe,” said Matt. “I’ll be here every
day to see you.”</p>

<p>“Sure you will. I couldn’t stand it if you stayed
away. The old runabout got me, after all!”</p>

<p>“You were lucky to escape as well as you did,” spoke
up the doctor. “You took a long automobile ride, after
you were hurt,” he added severely, “and did a number
of other things that were entirely unnecessary, and
which aggravated your condition.”</p>

<p>“Correct, doc,” grinned McGlory; “I was aggravated
a whole lot, and no mistake. Where’s the hoodoo car
now, Matt?”</p>

<p>“Billy’s got it in the garage.”</p>

<p>“I wonder that Billy would have it there, considering
how he feels about it.”</p>

<p>“Billy’s not the boss of the garage, Joe,” laughed
Matt. “If he was, probably he’d refuse to give the car
storage.”</p>

<p>“Hear anything from Hempstead?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes. Levitt is coming along as well as can be
expected.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you had better talk any more, my lad,”
interposed the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll die if I don’t, doc,” declared McGlory. “Give
me a little more rope, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“A little.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the colonel, Matt?” went on McGlory.</p>

<p>“No one knows, Joe. He was ordered out of town,
and I guess he’s gone, or going.”</p>

<p>“He played hob with me, all right. How’s the syndicate?”</p>

<p>“You’d feel highly complimented if you could hear
what they said about you.”</p>

<p>“What did they say about <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“Sure you don’t. You never remember what’s said
about you, but whenever any one tips you off concernin’
a pard you keep it right on tap. What are you going
to do for the two weeks I’m laid up?”</p>

<p>“Just hang around and wait for you to get well, I
guess,” Matt laughed.</p>

<p>“Don’t hike out of town, will you?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m going to stay right here.”</p>

<p>McGlory looked at the doctor.</p>

<p>“He’s my pard, doc,” said he. “Matt’s his label, and
he’s the clear quill any way you take him.”</p>

<p>“You both seem to stand pretty high in each other’s
estimation,” smiled the doctor.</p>

<p>“I’m standing higher in his than I deserve.”</p>

<p>“Cut that out, Joe,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut it out and paste it in my hat so I won’t forget
it. It’s the best lesson I ever had, and I’m going to
profit by it. Lost&mdash;a fortune! That’s me. I was promised
a place on Easy Street, and here I am in the hospital.”</p>

<p>McGlory chuckled.</p>

<p>“You may have lost a fortune, Joe,” said Matt, “but
you’ve won something a whole lot better.”</p>

<p>“I have&mdash;two busted ribs and a couple of weeks’ lay-off.
Oh, I’m a lucky dog!”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret about the ribs or the lay-off, Joe,” counseled
Matt. “If you get to worrying, you may have to
stay here longer than two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Funny how I shut my eyes in Random &amp; Griggs’
office,” remarked McGlory, leaping from one subject to
another with the abruptness of a person whose brain
is still a little befogged, “and open ’em here. That was
sure a hard ride from Hempstead in. I don’t know how
I managed to hang on. I reckon it was my wish to
play even with the colonel that held me up.”</p>

<p>“The colonel got his deserts, Joe,” said Matt.</p>

<p>“The syndicate was next to him all the time. Our
chasing in to tell what we knew didn’t make such a
terrible lot of difference.”</p>

<p>“It put us on record, that’s all. It’s mighty important,
sometimes, to let people know where you stand.”</p>

<p>“Correct, again. But listen. Didn’t Colonel Billings
pull a gun on you, Matt, before he left the office? Seems
to me I remember that.”</p>

<p>“He pulled a gun, Joe; but I don’t know what he intended
to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll put you next, pard. He intended to play
even with you.”</p>

<p>“Or you,” answered Matt.</p>

<p>“Not me,” insisted Joe. “The colonel knows I haven’t
got sense enough to make him much trouble. But he’s
afraid of Matt King. Look out for him, pard.”</p>

<p>“The colonel has his orders to leave town, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t mean that he’ll go. During the two
weeks I’m holding down this nice little bed here, you
keep both eyes skinned for Colonel Mark Antony Billings.
He’s liable to show his hand when you’re not
thinking he’s within a thousand miles of you. Pretty
sudden, the colonel is. He sprang a surprise on us when
we got to the Country Club and found him there to meet
us instead of Joshua Griggs. That’s a sample of the
way he does things, Matt. You look out for him.”</p>

<p>“That will do now,” said the doctor authoritatively.
“You’ve talked more than you ought to.”</p>

<p>“When’ll you blow in here again, pard?” added McGlory,
reaching out his hand.</p>

<p>“This afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That’s you. I’ve lost a fortune, pard, but I didn’t
let you get away from me. We’re pards, same as per
usual, and in spite of what happened at the Country
Club?”</p>

<p>“Sure we are. That couldn’t make any difference,
Joe.”</p>

<p>“It would have made a big difference with some fellows,
but Matt King’s of a different calibre.”</p>

<p>“That’s what pards are for, Joe,” whispered Matt
as he let go his chum’s hand, “to stand by each other.”</p>

<p>“Like you hung to me,” returned the cowboy, “and
not the way I stood by you. Well, I’ve had my lesson,
and we’ll let it go at that. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>Matt turned and left the ward, and the hospital.
There were a lot of people in New York, but it seemed
like a mighty lonesome place now that McGlory was laid
up for repairs.</p>

<p>The colonel, being a wise man, considered it good
policy to get away from New York, and head for his
favorite stamping grounds in the Southwest, for neither
Matt nor Joe ever saw him again.</p>

<p>When Joe got well Matt had found something in his
favorite line of motors to engage their attention, and
with such a team of hustlers to drive things, the business
could not be anything but a success.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MISSING_BOATS" id="THE_MISSING_BOATS">THE MISSING BOATS.</a></h2>


<p>Reflecting the hues of the sunset sky lay Lake Menatee
like a huge mirror.</p>

<p>Not a ripple stirred its placid surface.</p>

<p>The fading sunlight lent to its crystal depths the silver of
its dying glory.</p>

<p>While along its shores the forest like an over-reaching
shield outstretched its giant arms to cast weird, fantastic
figures first on the white beach, and then out, out over the
transparent bosom of the waters, going farther, faster and
faster, deeper and darker, until the veil of twilight concealed
the beautiful scene.</p>

<p>In the background the rugged Adirondacks kept watch
and ward over the treasures below, and on their seamed and
time-scarred forehead lingered the touch of sunlight long
after the shadows of gloom had robbed Lake Menatee of its
beauty.</p>

<p>Not a living creature was to be seen to give life to the
solitude of nature.</p>

<p>Three boats drawn up on the white sand lay side by side,
or at least within a few feet of each other.</p>

<p>They were merely common, flat-bottom rowboats.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about them.</p>

<p>The water may have reached to the stern of one, but to
not more than barely touch it.</p>

<p>Still a close observer might have seen it move, slightly it
is true, but yet a movement perceptible.</p>

<p>Gradually it neared the water’s edge, moved by an unseen
power.</p>

<p>So slowly did it move that fully an hour must have passed
before it had gained a foot.</p>

<p>Then the wind, which had died down at sunset, began
to sweep across the lake.</p>

<p>Gently, at first, it stirred the water’s tranquil surface, as
if fearful of disturbing its repose.</p>

<p>Anon it grew stronger.</p>

<p>From the mountains it mustered its powers.</p>

<p>The sleeping waters were awakened.</p>

<p>In angry waves they beat the shores.</p>

<p>The rising tide lent its aid to the mysterious force urging
the boat into its embrace.</p>

<p>Thus the boat was carried more rapidly away, and yet in
the next two hours’ time scarcely three feet was added to
the space gone over.</p>

<p>It must have been past midnight, when, with a last quivering
shock&mdash;a dying struggle, it seemed&mdash;and the boat swung
clear from the sand.</p>

<p>A minute later it floated slowly away.</p>

<p>At this moment a crash in the thick bushes, growing a
few rods from the shore, broke the calm and peaceful stillness
of the night.</p>

<p>An instant later and the form of a man uprose from the
gloom of his covert.</p>

<p>The moon was just peeping above the Adirondacks’ dark
crest, and it was light enough in the forest for one to have
seen that the man was past the prime of life, though his stalwart
form had borne the burden of years without losing its
erectness.</p>

<p>He was somewhat roughly clad, and his long hair and
flowing beard were unkempt. His eyes flashed brightly, but
a puzzled look rested on his sun-bronzed face. His words,
that fell involuntarily from his lips, furnished the key to
his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Waal, I hev got to believe it now. But if that don’t beat
all nater, then my name an’t Jarius Bede. See the thing
swim along, and there an’t been a living creetur near it
since long afore sundown! I can swear to that, for I an’t
let my eye off on’t in all that time. It is queer.”</p>

<p>As he finished his soliloquy the speaker went down to the
shore, but he did not step upon the sandy beach.</p>

<p>“I won’t do that,” he muttered, “for like as not I should
find myself in the midst of that pond afore I could say Bob
Bungles.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to explain the mystery he had witnessed.
The other boats had not moved.</p>

<p>“Waal, waal. I’ll trundle off hum,” concluded the mystified
Jarius Bede; “but as long as I stand up I know I shall
never see the beat of that!”</p>

<p>Throwing his gun over his shoulder, for he was armed
with a long, single-barreled old queen’s arm that had evidently
seen its share of service, he left the place with long,
loping strides, in the direction of home.</p>

<p>Ever and anon he glanced uneasily back, as if expecting
that he was to be followed by some mysterious foe.</p>

<p>“Makes a feller feel queer. Hello! the boys are looking
for me, I bet. I’m glad to see that light ennyway.”</p>

<p>A light was indeed visible in one of the valleys, and after
ten minutes’ walk he came to a rude house, or cabin, around
which could be seen a few acres of cultivated ground.</p>

<p>It was the house of one of the few settlers who had located
in that wild, out-of-the-way region.</p>

<p>Entering without knocking, half a dozen persons sprang
to their feet to greet him.</p>

<p>This family consisted of Jabez Bede, brother to Jarius,
his wife, three strapping sons, and a buxom daughter of
eighteen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, it’s only ’Rius!” exclaimed Dame Bede, with a look
of relief, as if she had feared some danger.</p>

<p>“But where have you been all night, Jarius?” cried Jabez.
“We were gettin’ a-worrited ’bout yer.”</p>

<p>“Jabez, I hev made a diskivery!”</p>

<p>“What?” chorused the listeners in a breath.</p>

<p>“I told yer I shouldn’t kem back till I had l’arnt sumthin’,
and I an’t, that, sure.”</p>

<p>“It is about Ralph, I know it is!” exclaimed Mary Bede,
springing to his side with a glad look on her fair countenance.
“What have you learned, uncle? Tell me, quick.”</p>

<p>“I can prove that he didn’t steal the boat,” was the triumphant
reply.</p>

<p>“I knew that he didn’t. But tell us what you have
learned.”</p>

<p>“Waal, waal, it’s cur’us, but it’s true. You know that the
three boats were left down on the shore as usual. Waal, I
hev been watchin’ them ever since an hour afore sundrop.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jarius Bede, and we here a-waitin’ and a-worritin’
’bout yer.”</p>

<p>“Waal, it’s worth the time, I can tell yer.”</p>

<p>While Jarius Bede is telling what he has witnessed we
would say that considerable excitement had been occasioned
among the few settlers in that vicinity by the frequent disappearance
of boats from the shores of the lake. No one
could tell where they had gone, but they were as effectually
lost as if the water had swallowed them up.</p>

<p>Finally, Mary Bede’s lover, Ralph Horn, was accused of
stealing, or destroying them, which amounted to the same
thing, so long as they were irretrievably lost.</p>

<p>We can understand now something of the eagerness with
which she listened to Jarius’ story. When he had finished all
were agape with wonder.</p>

<p>“Waal, I never!” exclaimed Jabez. “Who’d a-thought it?”</p>

<p>“And they will believe Ralph now?” asked Mary anxiously.</p>

<p>“They can’t help it, only we have got to prove it to
them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said her father. “How’ll we do that, ’Rius?
It’s an orful story to believe.”</p>

<p>“Let them see fer theirselves. Guess if they hed been with
me they’d a-thought somethin’ ’sides Ralph Horn was ’round
movin’ that boat. But I must catch a wink of sleep now.
In the mornin’ we’ll all go down and clear up the mystery.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the light was extinguished, and the
Bede family were in slumberland, though there may be a
doubt in regard to one member. But we won’t call any
names.</p>

<p>They were all astir early the next morning, and immediately
after breakfast Jarius spread the news of his
discovery.</p>

<p>It required no urging to get half a dozen to accompany
him to the lake, besides the three Bede boys.</p>

<p>To the surprise even of Jarius, the boat he had seen leave
the shore so mysteriously the night before was nowhere to
be seen either upon the lake or on the shores.</p>

<p>The other two were just as they had been left.</p>

<p>“Let’s put one of them jest where the runaway was and
then watch it.”</p>

<p>The idea was acted upon, and the entire party withdrew
into the cover of the growth to await the result.</p>

<p>A long, tedious watch followed, but to the disappointment
of all, as well as the chagrin of Jarius, the boat remained as
motionless as a rock. Not a first move was noticed.</p>

<p>“Wait a leetle longer,” whispered the puzzled Jarius; “I
thought I seed it wink jest a bit then.”</p>

<p>Half an hour passed, and still the object of their vain
watch had not been seen to stir.</p>

<p>“It’s cur’us,” muttered the leader; “but that other took
an orful long time to start. Why I was here nigh ’bout six
hours all told.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe it has to be night for it to move,” suggested one.</p>

<p>Be that the case or not, they watched until noon, when
they abandoned the fruitless task, and the mystery of the
missing boats was more unfathomable than ever.</p>

<p>Some vented their disappointment upon Jarius Bede, and
others were silent, not knowing what to say.</p>

<p>Jarius was completely dumfounded, and well he might be.</p>

<p>“Tan’t any use to watch longer,” growled one. “We’ve
been a set of fools. The idea of a boat’s moving! Jarius
is mad, and we are fools. Come, we shall be the laughing-stock
of all who hear of it. I’ll bet my gun Jarius got us
down here on purpose for some game. If I thought he had&mdash;&mdash;”
and a latent look shone in his flashing eyes.</p>

<p>Jarius did not reply. He had enough to think of besides.
Dropping upon his knees, he looked the boat over and over,
and around it. He moved it, but it lay a dead weight upon
the earth.</p>

<p>“It’s queer,” he muttered. “I can swear to what I saw
with my own eyes, but I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>He had regained his feet, and was about to leave the
place, when suddenly something seemed to catch his attention
and hold it.</p>

<p>Pointing to the edge of the water a moment later, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Look there, boys! See that sand move! There’s something
under it! I&mdash;I have diskivered the mystery!”</p>

<p>Seizing one of the boat’s paddles, Jarius quickly cleared
away the sand where he had seen it move, when a large
turtle was disclosed to their gaze.</p>

<p>Upon further search another was found buried deeper
than its mate.</p>

<p>“Waal, waal, it’s plain as daylight now. They were under
that boat and moved it! T’others were moved in the same
way. But we didn’t get this one over the critters.”</p>

<p>“Who’d a-thought!” ejaculated his brother, while the
others were speechless with amazement.</p>

<p>“But where do they go to?” asked one, at last.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell yer!” cried Jarius, as a new idea suddenly entered
his head; “they drift down to the outlet and into Mad
River. You know an empty boat would fare hard there;
and we an’t never looked there for them.”</p>

<p>Mad River found its way through a narrow, rocky defile
where few had ever penetrated, but an exploration into the
wild region was rewarded by discovering the wrecks of two
boats. Though the others were never found their disappearance
was no longer a mystery.</p>

<p>Of course, Ralph Horn was cleared of all suspicion in the
affair, and that fall there was a happy wedding at the Bede
farm. We need not tell who the bride was, and we can’t tell
of “the years of happiness that followed,” as story-tellers
are wont to say, for it was only last week the marriage vows
were spoken.</p>

<h2><a name="ESKIMOS_TAKE_TO_REINDEERS" id="ESKIMOS_TAKE_TO_REINDEERS">ESKIMOS TAKE TO REINDEERS.</a></h2>


<p>A letter from Alaska in the New York <cite>Sun</cite> recently has
the following interesting facts:</p>

<p>Of the twenty thousand reindeer under government supervision
in Alaska about two thousand are above the Arctic
Circle where the climate is much more severe than in their
old feeding grounds in Siberia, from which they were carried
by the United States revenue cutters some years ago.
The reports of the local superintendents of reindeer herds
will be forwarded in this, the second mail to leave the Arctic
this year. These reports will show a very small increase in
the herds.</p>

<p>The mortality among the fawns this last year was very
great, owing to the blizzards which swept over the tundras in
April and May when the fawning season was on. Newly born
fawns, unable to stand up in the blinding storms and help
themselves to nourishment, froze to death by hundreds within
ten minutes after birth. Wolves and half-wolf dogs also
killed many in some of the herds.</p>

<p>At present the herds are kept out on the open tundra near
the sea, where there is no protection from the cutting blasts.
District Superintendent A. N. Evans has arranged to have
the deer taken inland next spring at least as far as the foothills,
where the peculiar white moss on which the creatures
feed is abundant, and where there is ample protection from
the winds. It is hoped that this will save the fawns and
prevent the heavy loss of the present year being repeated.</p>

<p>An encouraging feature of the work here, far from markets
and utterly shut out from any considerable contact with
white men, is the fact that the native is slowly but certainly
coming to recognize the great possibilities of the reindeer
industry. While every effort has been made to give as many
natives as possible an interest in the herds by direct ownership
of some of the deer, the owners of deer are still a very
small minority.</p>

<p>So valuable has a government apprenticeship come to be
considered that it has often been the deciding factor in determining
the outcome of the dusky love affairs. “When
you get some reindeer I will be your wife,” says the Innuit
maiden with the tattooed chin. These wise young ladies
know that the ownership of deer carries with it as a usual
thing three or four years of first-class government rations
and piles of cloth and clothing which Uncle Sam throws
about in the Arctic with a generous hand. So among the
natives there is developing a sort of reindeer aristocracy
quite at variance with the old democratic, communistic ideas
of the others who hold no property worth while, and who
have not been favored by the government.</p>

<p>As only a limited number can be appointed apprentices
every year, and thus draw government rations, many are
now trying to get deer from other natives without waiting
for government favors. In this few have succeeded, for the
owners, recognizing their great value, are running the price
of female reindeer skyward. With the destruction of the
country’s game and the rising standard of life among the
natives the population will come more and more to depend
upon the reindeer industry, which will doubtless develop
rapidly.</p>

<p>Living in a savage state of society with no other domestic
animal than the half-tamed malamoot dog, the process of
teaching the Eskimo how to take care of deer has been slow.
Severe measures have had to be resorted to in many cases to
compel the natives to keep their dogs from the deer camp.</p>

<p>Also it has been found difficult to prevent those who have
no deer from shooting the unfortunate animals that stray
away from the herd. These are considered legitimate prey
and until recently were hunted the same as caribou. This
year, however, a great many of these stray deer have been
picked up and put back into the herds which they had deserted.</p>

<p>It has thus been found necessary to put the native herder
through a course of training. Those who get their deer
directly from the government serve an apprenticeship of four
years. They are bound by a written contract, the strict
terms of which they cannot violate without peril of losing
their annual allotment of reindeer and suffering discharge
from the service.</p>

<p>During the first three years of their apprenticeship they
receive in addition to the reindeer a generous supply of food
free of charge. Cloth, clothing, traps, guns, and ammunition
are also given to the fortunate apprentice, who soon becomes
a person of consequence in the community. For these governmental
favors the apprentice is supposed to take care of
his own deer and to assist in caring for the government deer.</p>

<p>The work of the herder in a reindeer camp is not arduous,
and seems to be especially attractive to the carefree native.
Ordinarily the deer have a way of taking care of themselves
that suits the native. Every day an apprentice drives the
herd to some feeding ground, where they feed while the
herder saunters about or hunts ptarmigan or other game near
at hand.</p>

<p>If the moss is poor the deer may feed for six hours, at the
end of which time they are driven back to the vicinity of the
camp and allowed to remain there until the next feeding
time, while the ease-loving servants of the government sleep
or whittle fine old ivory into curios to be traded off on the
ships for the tobacco which Uncle Sam overlooked in ordering
the shiploads of supplies which annually find their way to
the reindeer camps of Alaska.</p>

<p>True, there is other work to be done. Every spring along
comes fawning season, and the deer herders have to stand
watch day and night by turns. Now and then the long, wild
note of the Arctic wolf is heard through the midwinter gloom
and a constant watch must be kept by well-armed men. The
repeating rifle made wolves so scarce, however, that dogs
are by far the greatest source of danger.</p>

<p>It seems utterly impossible to train the malamoot dog to
herd deer. At sight of a deer the tamest malamoot becomes
as uncontrollable as though he had never known human
restraint and were once more a plain wolf.</p>

<p>Besides guarding the herd occasionally from these dangers,
there are sled deer to be trained, and every June there is a
kind of round-up, when the young fawns are marked, along
with all deer that have changed owners during the year. In
the ear of each government deer a little aluminum button is
riveted securely, but all private owners and herders have a
mark which must be registered with the local superintendent
and also at Washington. This mark is made by cutting the
ear.</p>

<p>So far the native in the Far North has made almost no use
of the wonderfully rich milk of the reindeer. This milk,
which is as white as the Arctic snows, is at least ninety
per cent. cream. In fact, it is practically all a rich, snow-white,
sugary cream. It is the most nourishing milk in the
world, but the government has so far supplied the camps
with condensed milk, and the herders have preferred opening
cans to milking deer.</p>

<p>Unlike the Laplander, the Eskimo does not make a pet of
his favorite deer. When he wants to milk her she is lassoed
and thrown down. When her legs are carefully tied with
walrus skin strings and her horns are safely held by some
stout friend, the process of milking begins. When the last
drop is extracted the highly indignant animal is unlashed
and allowed to get up and go about her business.</p>

<p>Sometimes a horn is knocked off or a leg broken before
the struggling reindeer understands that she is to be milked
and not branded or butchered. Under the circumstances the
dairying feature of Arctic life is not very prominent, and the
milkmaid’s song is not welcomed by the wise little animals
that have undergone the torture of one milking.</p>

<p>If the boys of ten or fifteen years ago could have secured such thoroughly good adventure stories, of such
great length, at five cents per copy, the <b>Brave and Bold Weekly</b>, had it been published then, would have
had ten times its present large circulation. You see, in those days, stories of the quality of those now published
in the <b>Brave and Bold Weekly</b> were bound in cloth covers or else published little by little in boys’
serial papers, under which circumstances each story was paid for at the rate of one dollar or more.</p>

<p>Now we give the boys of America the opportunity of getting the same stories and better ones for five cents.
Do you not think it is a rare bargain? Just buy any one of the titles listed below and read it; you will not be
without <b>Brave and Bold</b> afterward. Each story is complete in itself and has no connection whatever with
any story that was published either before or after it.</p>

<p>We give herewith a list of all of the back numbers in print. You can have your newsdealer order them or
they will be sent direct by the publishers to any address upon receipt of the price in money or postage stamps.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
